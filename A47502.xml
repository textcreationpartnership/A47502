            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now above ten years ſince my oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions would permit me to read any Book of this nature, I confeſs that in my minority I was a great lover of Books of Knighthood, and my fancy coſt my purſe, for I then tranſlated and printed two Books of this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſince which time I wholly left that ſtudy; but ſome friends of late knowing that I formerly recreated my ſelf in reading theſe ſorts of Hiſtories, deſired me to write this, informing me that it was much wanted: Their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and my own leiſure permitting me, I began it, and have whether (happily or not I know not) now fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it. I am ſure I ſhall be cenſured by many, and ſome will ſuppoſe me to be as wild and extravagant as <hi>Don Quixot</hi> to renew Knight-errantry, but if he had been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ſo much reaſon as to have written one, it would have prevented him from exerciſing that quality, and I believe have returned leſs to his diſadvantage; for he might have ſaved both his Ribs and Teeth, and his Squire <hi>Sancho Pancha</hi> would neither have been blanketted nor cudgel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
<pb facs="tcp:55264:3"/>
without doubt had he been poſſeſſed of ſo much brains as to have written one, he would then have known that there was more of fancy then truth, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not have expoſed himſelf to thoſe many hazardous adventures which he undertook, and not have taken Wind mils for Giants, Flocks of Sheep for Armies, and a Barbers Baſon for the Golden Helmet of <hi>Mambrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> I know he intended to have begun that adventure, which I have now finiſhed, as the Author of his Hiſtory in the firſt Chapter of his firſt Book learnedly writes, but he was hindred by his extravagant madneſs. That which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted and was ſome years in atcheiving, I have now written in a few days; for in the invention and writing I ſpent not a full week. They that will beſtow the pains in reading of it, will finde ſomewhat of recreation, I am ſure the Story in the firſt Part is well enough continued in this Second, and all the adventures that are promiſed there, are proſecuted here. Many people love Romances, but ſome are grown ſo ſqueamiſh, that there muſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of improbability, neither Giant nor Enchantment, becauſe there is none in our age. To whom I anſwer, That this Hiſtory is not of people of our time, but of many ages paſt, and we know that ſacred Writ mentions both and Poetry allows of them. There is ſomewhat in this Book both of the old manner of Romances and ſomewhat of the new: Indeed the neweſt form, as that of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Caſſandra</hi> contents me beſt, but I was not to follow that way in this Hiſtory, leſt this Second Part ſhould neither be brother, nor have affinity with the firſt, and ſo be either as a baſtard or ſtranger: Such as it is you now have it, they that delight in this ſort of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
<pb facs="tcp:55264:4"/>
if they approve of this, may have a third Part, &amp; it is poſſible more, as the Stationer receives incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If it be not liked, there is too much of it already; and to thoſe that wholly diſlike it, and would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the onely Wits of the times, let them mend it, and I then doubt not but I ſhall finde ſomewhat to diſlike in theirs. This is no tranſlation but fancy: we have many pleaſant and ingenious Romances in the Engliſh tongue, but we are obliged to other nations for their invention of them: very few have been written originally in Engliſh, and onely Sir <hi>Philip Sidneys Arcadia</hi> hath had the ſucceſs to be not onely approved of in our own language, but rendred into French and other languages. If this piece had been written a hundred years ago (though it be in nothing ſo worthy as that) yet it is likely that it might have been likewiſe tranſlated, becauſe the firſt part was written originally in Italian. Thus have I given you a taſte of my Fancy, if it recreats or contents you in the reading, as much as it did me in the writing, I have my deſires, and by your approving of this, you may incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me to hear further from me, till when I reſt, if you like me,</p>

                  <p>How the City of <hi>Bollera</hi> being ſtraitly beſieged by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, was well near taken, but that it was reſcued by <hi>Gorino</hi> Brother to the Duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> and the <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks</hi> and his Companions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now full time to return to the City of <hi>Bollera,</hi> where we left the thrice renowned and moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Emperor <hi>Don Bellaneo,</hi> in company of ſo many valiant and renowned Knights and great Perſonages, who were ſtraitly beſieged by the Souldan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and his ſon <hi>Perianeo Knight of the Images.</hi> After the laſt Battel was ended, which is largely deſcribed in the 59th Chapter of the Firſt Part of this excellent Hiſtory, the Emperor commanded that a ſtrict and juſt account ſhould be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55264:5"/>
taken of how many Fighting men were left in the City and Trenches; which Command being put in execution by Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> and <hi>Sabian</hi> of <hi>Trebanto,</hi> who were very vigilant and careful therein: and after they had taken a juſt account thereof, they delivered it to <hi>Don Bellaneo,</hi> whereby they found that there was not above fifty thouſand men both in the City and Trenches, and that they had loſt ten thouſand men: for the Duke brought twenty thouſand men with him from <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> and there was within the City beſides forty thouſand fighting men: when as on the other ſide the Souldan had at leaſt four hundred thouſand fighting men, beſides above fifty thouſand which were ſlain in the laſt Battel, and the Souldans men dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed, and many good and hardy Knights and Giants from all parts of the Empire of <hi>Perſia</hi> came in daily to them at the brute of theſe Wars, and for the love that they bore to their magnanimous and redoubted Prince <hi>Perianeo</hi> Knight of the Images, for whoſe return there was great Ioy throughout all thoſe Countreys.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, great was the grief and ſorrow of the moſt péerleſs Princeſs <hi>Perſiana,</hi> (who was married to the Duke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firon,</hi> as is before recounted) and for whoſe ſake alone all theſe Wars were begun, and in whoſe Quarrel many redoubted Knights had loſt their lives. As much troubled was the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Princeſs <hi>Aurora,</hi> for the abſence of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> the Knight of <hi>The Golden Image,</hi> and <hi>Don Brianel,</hi> whoſe ſucceſs in the winning of her Kingdom, and other ſtrange Adventures ſhe had not yet heard of. But all theſe ſorrows were ſomewhat mitigated, in that the City was ſo well guarded by <hi>Don Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> Knight of <hi>The Imperial Crowns,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Princes and Knights.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Thus the Battel continued indifferent on both ſides, till <hi>Boraldo</hi> and <hi>Don Fermoſel</hi> arrived with their ſeveral Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of fifty thouſand men a piece, brake thorough the rancks of their enemies, and attempted to force their way into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which they endeavored by all means poſsible to effect, for they brought Scaling-Ladders, and all other inſtruments of War fitting to aſſault it: which when Duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> and the reſt of the Knights heard, they immediately retreated into the City, knowing that it was but weakly manned, and not able long to reſiſt the furious aſſaults that would be made.</p>
               <p>Thus the Emperor (who as I told you before was ingaged in a bloody Fight with <hi>the Knight of the Images</hi>) was forced to leave the Combate unfiniſhed, to retire to the City to reſcue it, which he heard was well nigh taken: being come néer the gates of the City, he ſaw that the enemy had gotten poſſeſsion of part of the wall, and likewiſe he ſaw <hi>the Knight of the Images</hi> coming behind him with all his Forces, wherefore he ſéeing the extreamity of the buſineſs haſted into the City, and ſtood in réer of all his Forces, and was the laſt man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, holding a continual Fight with his enemies, till he ſaw all his own Forces were within the walls, and then he himſelf entred, not permitting any of his enemies Forces to enter with

him, which they by all means attempted to do: ſo ſoon as he was entred, and the gate ſtrongly faſtned, he repaired to that part of the wall which he ſaw was poſſeſſed by the enemy, and mounting thereon, being followed by ſeveral valiant Knights, ſoon tumbled the enemies from the wall, and kept the poſſeſsion thereof; but all this and what ever elſe they could do, did not hinder the enemy from getting the poſſeſsion of the wall in many places, which they at laſt kept in deſpight of all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the City, and were ready to deſcend the wall and enter the City, when they heard a great noiſe of Trumpets and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions, and a great company of armed Knights behind them, who gave a great aſſault to thoſe of their Forces that were below; at which they were greatly aſtoniſhed, and ſéeing them come forward with a great deal of impetuoſity and deſtruction of many of their Forces, the chief Commander who had gotten the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of the wall, came down to help their companions, and the reſt, who ſtill remained on the wall, were ſoon forced from thence, and thrown headlong down, where they ended their lives.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Battel again revived, and many of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans Knights and Giants loſt their lives, by the invincible arms of four or five Knights, who came in company of the late Forces that came to relieve the City: but among the reſt, there was one Knight who was armed with an armor garniſhed with Baſilisks, that put all men to amaze, for they rather judged him to be a raging Tyger, or hungry Lion, then any mortal Knight; for in a ſhort time he diſmounted above fifty Knights, and killed four Giants, and yet he was not at all wearied, but ſtill beſtowed ſuch deadly ſtrokes amongſt the Souldans knights, that they all fled from him as from their immediate death, till at laſt the two brothers, <hi>Caroliano</hi> and <hi>Boraldo,</hi> both aſſaulted him, and laid many weighty ſtrokes both on his Sheild and Helmet, but he reached one of them ſo great a blow, that he made him catch hold on his horſes neck, to ſave himſelf from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and then being much inraged gave the other ſuch a thruſt that he tumbled him from his horſe, and ſo he procéeded killing and deſtroying all that durſt withſtand him. In the mean time his other four companions were not idle, for they behaved
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55264:7"/>
themſelves with extraordinary courage. It was two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, when this battel firſt began, and now it was about four of the clock in the afternoon, and yet it was not ended: but at laſt the Souldans Knights and Giants being much wearied, were about to retreat when they once more ſaw freſh Forces coming towards them, which was indéed commanded by the Souldan himſelf, who ſéeing the Battel continue ſo long, and underſtanding by a meſſenger that the City was likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, came on with all his Forces to aſſiſt his Son, whereby he might, as he hoped, put an end to this troubleſom War: but he found himſelf to be bravely received by <hi>the Knight of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilisks</hi> and his companions.</p>
               <p>When they in the City ſaw this, they informed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Don Bellaneo</hi> thereof, who commanded one of the Gates to be immediately opened, out of which he iſſued with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, and went immediately to the place where <hi>the Knight of the Baſilisks</hi> was engaged, and ſéeing him do ſuch wonders, and ſuppoſing him to command the reſt, he ſaid to him: Knight, ſince you have, though unknown, endeavored to give us ſo great aid, I pray let it be uſed to the beſt advantage, which will be at this time with all convenient ſpéed, to retire into the City, elſe you will preſently be overpowred by their great Forces, and then your aſsiſtance will be of little effect. The <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks</hi> gave attention to this advice, and knowing not onely the perſon that gave it, but that it was alſo very good, endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his own example and actions, to retire to the City, and ſo he and his companions did with all their Forces, onely with the loſs of two thouſand men which were killed in the Battel, and retreat. And the Souldan and his Son, <hi>the Knight of the Images,</hi> ſéeing themſelves forced to retire from the City walls, by reaſon of the approaching of the night, which was now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on, retired into their enemies trenches, with a reſolution to abide there till they could take the City, but they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, as hereafter ſhall be declared.</p>

               <p>The Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> being informed of the return of <hi>Don Brianel,</hi> ſent for him to give her an account of his Adventures in <hi>Antioch,</hi> and it was not long ere he, accompanied with his two Companions, <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> came into her preſence, and falling on his knées to kiſs her hand, ſhe refuſed to grant it, but raiſed him and his Companions from the ground with much fréedom and joy; he being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what emboldened by her fréedom, did ariſe and ſalute her, which ſhe courteouſly received: and then ſhe ſeating her ſelf in her Chair, cauſed other ſeats to be brought for <hi>Don Brianel</hi> and his Companions: where they being ſeated, and <hi>Don Brianel</hi> knowing for what cauſe he was ſent for, immediately declared unto her the good ſucceſs of his Embaſſie, and how that by the aſſiſtance of thoſe two Knights there preſent, and of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> as alſo by the advice and help of <hi>Palineo</hi> and <hi>Damartino,</hi> he had ſlain the Vſurping King <hi>Tramolcano</hi> and the Count <hi>Garino,</hi> and reduced the Kingdom to her obedience; and that there was nothing now wanting but her preſence to make her ſubjects happy, and that they were all ready to obey her in every thing, and in the mean time till ſhe could come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they had ſworn Oaths of Allegiance to <hi>Damartino,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her orders and command.</p>
               <p>This news greatly contented the Princeſs, and ſhe returned many thanks to <hi>Don Brianel</hi> and his companions, after which they departed from her preſence, and went to the place where the Emperor, his Son, and Duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> with the reſt of the Commanders, were in Councel about what was neceſſary to be done, as well for the defence of themſelves, as for the offending of their enemies, and there it was concluded to ſend <hi>Don Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineo</hi> to <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> to attend the landing of two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, who were come from <hi>Greece</hi> with the Emperor, and gave him orders that he ſhould conduct thoſe Forces directly t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

and ſo they ſhould be left frée.

               <p>The City of <hi>Perſepolis</hi> being thus aſſaulted, ſome of the Forces went immediately to the Souldans Camp before <hi>Bolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> to certifie him thereof, where they arrived one morning ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt as the Souldan and his Son with all their Forces, were going to aſſault the City: but they were much aſtoniſhed with this news, and did greatly wonder from whence all thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould arrive, however commanding the Meſſengers to ſilence, they reſolved to give the On-ſet to the City before they departed, and thereupon went forwards with all their accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of War. <hi>Perianeo</hi> Knight <hi>of the Images</hi> being extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily enraged, immediately got a Ladder and mounted the wall, where he ſoon either cut in pieces, or tumbled down all ſuch as were placed there to oppoſe him, and was ready to have deſcended the wall &amp; entred the City, when the Emperor himſelf, and ſeveral other valiant Knights in his company, came and reſiſted him: Many fierce and hardy blows were given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

on both ſides, for they had both an implacable hatred to each other, and the Emperor knowing that if he could vanquiſh that enemy, he ſhould eaſily force the reſt to retire, laid mighty ſtrokes on the Knight <hi>of the Images,</hi> ſo that in the end he put him quite out of breath, and inforced him to retire from the wall in deſpight of all the reſiſtance he could poſsibly make: all this while the reſt of the Knights and Giants on both ſides, were not idle, but did their uttermoſt endeavors, the one to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, and the other to defend the wall, which indéed was ſo well guarded by ſo many valiant and magnanimous Knights, that indéed the flower of all Chivalry was there preſent, and therefore the Moat which incompaſſed the City, was in a manner filled with the blood and dead bodies of the aſſaylants; which the Souldan perceiving, and knowing that his preſence was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and indéed more neceſſary in another place, he cauſed his Forces to retreat, which he could hardly effect, in regard of the deſperateneſs of the Fight in all places, at laſt he withdrew his Forces, and finding that he had gained nothing, but that this Onſet had coſt him the loſe of fifty thouſand men, he reſolved to depart that night, and retire to <hi>Perſepolis.</hi>

               <p>Thoſe in the City ſéeing their enemies withdrawn, in good order returned to their ſeveral Quarters, where they greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in their good fortune: The Emperor and his Son with all the reſt of thoſe couragious Knights, reſolving the next day to iſſue out of the City, and ſet upon their enemies in the open field: but when the next morning was come, and they were ready to put this their reſolution in execution, they found that all their enemies were departed, having taken the benefit of the night for that purpoſe, wherefore they went and diſarmed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then went again to counſel, where they reſolved to do as followeth.</p>

               <p>THe Emperor <hi>Don Bellaneo,</hi> and the reſt of the Knights being entred into council, it was concluded that every one ſhould provide himſelf to depart from that City, and follow the Souldan: They very well knowing that the Forces of the Emperor, under the command of <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> being arrived at <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> and the Souldan being informed thereof, was the cauſe of his ſo ſudden departure, wherefore <hi>Don Alfiron,</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> &amp; the reſt of the Knights, went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to put their Forces in readineſs; which when they had done, they came to the Court to the Ladies, to take their fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of them.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> was much troubled and perplexed, that ſhe ſhould ſo ſoon leave her husband the Duke, and was greatly diſcontented that all this war was occaſioned thorough her Marriage with the Duke, whereby the lives of ſo many brave Knights were put into continual jeopardy, wherefore ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought

               <p>The Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> was likewiſe much troubled that her affairs was thus hindred by theſe Wars, but her diſcontent was the greater in that <hi>Don Brianel</hi> and ſhe muſt part; wherefore ſhe applied her ſelf to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and calling him <hi>Her Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,</hi> deſired him to make all the haſte he could poſsible in his return thither, that he might put her in poſſeſsion of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which he promiſed to do, but ſhe not ſatisfied with this, deſired that ſome one of his companions might be left in that City for the guard thereof.

               <p>NO ſooner had the Golden Charioteér of Heaven ſet forward on his dayly Iourney, to illuminate the world with the refulgent Beams of his Countenance, but all our Combatants prepared themſelves for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> in whoſe heart was not onely revenge but jealouſie, deſired that he might combat with his Rival <hi>Perianeo</hi> Knight <hi>of the Images.</hi> The good Emperor his Father reſolved to try the Valor of <hi>Gramalis</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> and <hi>Contumeliano</hi> deſired to undertake the two Brothers <hi>Caroliano</hi> and <hi>Boraldo.</hi>

               <p>Thus every one having made choice with whom to fight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to overcome or die in the place, and they onely expected the coming of the Challengers out of the City. About ten of the Clock before Noon, the Souldan with a Guard of Forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Knights iſſued out of one of the Gates with the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, ready for the Combat. The Souldan being ſeated in a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55264:13"/>
place appointed for that purpoſe, and the Guard placed without one ſide of the Liſts, the Challengers with the ſound of Drums and Trumpets entred the ſame, where they had not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, but the Defendants likewiſe entred, and the Guard on their ſide being placed on another ſide of the Liſts: the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan commanded the Signal of the Fight to be given by the Trumpets, at whoſe ſound the Knights with armed fury made againſt each other in ſuch ſort, that they rather ſeemed ſo many ſudden flaſhes of Lightning, breaking through the airy paſſage of the Heaven, than men and horſe met in the midſt of the field with ſo mighty encounters, as if ſo many pieces of Ordnance had béen diſcharged. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> thinking himſelf concerned more than ordinary, encountred the <hi>Knight of the Images</hi> ſo violently, that he cauſed him to lay hold on his horſe neck to ſave himſelf from falling, and with the ſhock that he received, be loſt both his ſtirrops: but they both ſoon recovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and turning about, with a brave grace and courage drew their Swords, and gave one another ſuch ſtrong and mighty blows, that their pure cutting Sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Emperor and <hi>Gramalis</hi> of <hi>Thrace</hi> encountred each other ſo furiouſly, that the Emperor threw <hi>Gramalis</hi> on the ground, and diſabled his horſe, and received ſo great a ſhock himſelf that he loſt both his ſtirrops, but he recovered himſelf, and drawing his Sword went to méet his Adverſary, who was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him on foot; which he ſéeing, likewiſe diſmounted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and came on foot likewiſe valiantly to méet him: but <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis</hi> being more ready than the Emperor, gave him ſo mighty a blow on the Helmet, that it aſtoniſhed him, which made his rage to kindle in his breaſt, that the very fire ſparkled in his eyes, and like a hot chafed Boar or hungry Lyon bent to his prey, wounded <hi>Gramalis</hi> that had ſtruck him with ſo puiſſant a blow on the Helmet, that he cut it in two as if it had béen of Paſte-board, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

abaſhed, ſo that covering himſelf with his Shield, he gave the Emperor many wounds; which he féeling, and reſolving to be revenged of, gave his enemy ſo great a blow on the Shield, that he cut it in two pieces, and wounded him ſo ſorely on the head and arm, that be in ſhort time fell to the ground: which the Emperor ſéeing he left him, and went to Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> who wanted his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfiron</hi> and <hi>Contumeliano</hi> encountring the two Brothers, gave to each other ſo marvellous encounters, that they all meaſured their lengths on the earth: but like valiant Knights they ſoon got on their féet and began an excellent Combat, which continued a long time without any great advantage; but in the end <hi>Caroliano,</hi> with whom <hi>Alfiron</hi> fought, gave him ſo great a blow on the head, that he cut the Laces of his Helmet, and ſomewhat wounded his head; but <hi>Alfiron</hi> reſolving to revenge himſelf, gave <hi>Caroliano</hi> ſo mighty a blow on the Helmet, that it much aſtoniſhed him, and paſſing from thence wounded his ſhoulder very ſorely: but the blow having found ſo great reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his Sword brake in two pieces; whereupon <hi>Caroliano</hi> though ſorely wounded, ſéeing his Adverſary without Helmet or Sword, went forward with a reſolution that one blow ſhould put an end to the Combat: but juſt as he went to perform what be intended, the Emperor met him and reſcued <hi>Alfiron,</hi> who ſéeing the deſperateneſs of his condition, being without a ſword, eſpied that of <hi>Gramalis</hi> lying by him, ſuddenly took it up, and went to receive his enemy, who was now fighting with the Emperor. <hi>Contumeliano</hi> and his enemy were not idle, but did their utmoſt devoirs like good Knights, to endanger each other, ſo that the ground where they ſtood was dyed with the blood that came from the great number of wounds they received.</p>
               <p>This Battel had continued eight hours, and neither of the two Knights, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> nor <hi>Perianeo,</hi> ſhewed any kinde of wearineſs; and though they were much wounded, yet continued they as vigorous and ſtrong as at the beginning. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being much enraged hereat, did his utmoſt endeavor to put his enemy out of breath, which he did perform by his quickneſs and multitude of ſtrokes which he gave him, ſo that in the end
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55264:14"/>
his enemy could not hurt him, and did nothing but defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But <hi>Perianeo</hi> being enraged that he was ſo likely to be overcome, reſolved to put all his ſtrength to one blow, which he did in ſuch ſort, that ſtriking <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> on the Helmet, he put him out of all remembrance, and his horſe being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wounded, ran about the field with him. So ſoon as he came to himſelf, and found in what condition he was, and that his enemy purſued him to take away his life, he caught hold on his Sword which hung to his Wriſt with a Chain, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged far more than any Bull or Lion, he lifted up his Sword and gave his enemy ſo great a blow on the thigh, that he cut him to the hard bone, from which wound iſſued much blood; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled his ſtroke in ſuch manner on his Adverſaries Helm, that he beat him quite from his horſe without any ſenſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: and looking about him, ſaw the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> likewiſe on the ground with one blow he had received from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roliano</hi> on the head, where he had nothing to defend it: But the Emperor ſoon revenged this wrong, for he gave <hi>Caroliano</hi> ſo mighty a blow on the head, that he laid him on the earth. <hi>Contumeliano</hi> and his adverſary <hi>Boraldo</hi> were both grown very faint, and <hi>Contumeliano</hi> was at laſt forced to retire. <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> perceiving how the day was likely to be their own, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted from his horſe with a reſolution to kill <hi>Don Perianeo,</hi> if he were not dead already: but on an inſtant there happened a great flaſh of Lightning and Thunder, and there iſſued from a Cloud a Charriot of Fire drawn by ſix Griffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Souldan, <hi>it is neceſſary for the preſervation of the life of thy dear Son, and his Companion, to carry them to ſuch a place as I have provided: but aſſure thy ſelf that they ſhall be both heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their wounds, and the young</hi> Siconian Lyon <hi>ſhall make large

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Pillar and the Prophecy thereon, was beheld and read by many: and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Father went to Duke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firon,</hi> and took him, he being in a ſwoond and ſorely wounded, and delivered him to ſome who carried him to a Tent: and both the Knights <hi>Contumeliano</hi> and <hi>Boraldo</hi> with weakneſs and loſs of blood having long wreſtled together, fell down in a Trance; but <hi>Caroliano</hi> was quite killed with the blow he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Emperor. The field being thus cleared of the dead and wounded, the Souldan came from his Seat to ſée what was engraven on the Pillar; which when he had read, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately vaniſhed away.</p>
               <p>Thus this Combat being finiſhed, the Souldan with all his Guard returned to the City in great ſorrow, carrying with them <hi>Boraldo</hi> much wounded, and the dead body of <hi>Caroliano:</hi> and the Emperor and his Son returned to their Tents with the wounded body of <hi>Contumeliano, Alfiron</hi> being ſent before.</p>

And hereupon they brake off their friendly and amorous Diſcourſe, taking a farewel of each other, he returning to put all things in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the next days Expedition and ſhe retiring her ſelf into her Cloſet, to contemplate what ſhe had done.</p>

               <p>Thus travelled they with much content, till at length they met ſome of the Knights of the Emperors Army, who were come on purpoſe to méet them: and then ſome were ſent back to ſignifie to the Emperor and the reſt of the Princes, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of thoſe Princeſſes; which they no ſooner underſtood, but they went out to méet them. Two leagues from the Camp they were met by the Emperor, <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> the Duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Teſſifanty,</hi> and all thoſe other moſt Renowned Princes and States, who coming near them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted

from their horſes to ſalute them. The Princeſſes ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, deſcended from their Chariots and kindly received them: Then two ſtately Palfreys were brought whereon the two Princeſſes were mounted, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> took hold of the Reins of the Princeſs <hi>Aurora's</hi> Palfrey, and the Emperor himſelf did the ſame for <hi>Perſiana.</hi>

                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> during the remainder of their Iourney, asked the Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> whether ſhe had received any content in the company of <hi>Don Brianel?</hi> For, ſaith he, I ſée by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that he is very much pleaſed, and he ſheweth very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly with the Favor that he hath tyed to his arm, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire to know what Miſtriſs he hath gotten ſince our departure.

               <p>In ſuch like communication ſpent they their time, till they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Camp, where they alighted and were received with great Ioy, ſignified by the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Night being come, every one repaired to their ſeveral Lodgings, and there took their ordinary repoſe, onely <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that he was ſtill kept there, and hindered from viſiting his Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and beſides he knew not how to go to her, for his Father expected upon the Concluſion of the Peace, that he would return with him to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe meditations he ſpent moſt part of the night, and when morning came he aroſe and diſpatched a Meſſenger into the City, to certifie the Souldan of his Daughters Arrival, and to know his pleaſure what ſhould be done. To which the Souldan returned anſwer, That he expected her and the Duke
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55264:19"/>
to come to his preſence that day, in company of what other Knights they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>The Duke and Princeſs being certified hereof, prepared themſelves for that purpoſe, and about Noon, onely accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Princeſs <hi>Aurora, Don Bellianis,</hi> and <hi>Don Bria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> they entred the City, and came into the preſence of the Souldan, who was ſeated on a Throne, and his great Lords about him. The Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> and the Duke humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on their knées, and ſhe humbly deſired her Father to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give her raſhneſs, for it was onely true love that cauſed her to do the ſame, and promiſed him that if he would deign to pardon that great fault, ſhe would in all things continue his obedient Daughter during life, and concluding her Spéech, ſhe ſhed many tears: To which the Souldan replyed, That her diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Commands, had occaſioned the loſs of the lives of many of his Subjects, and that therefore ſhe might expect the Gods to be continually angred with all her undertakings; but as for his part, ſéeing ſhe had made ſo frée a Confeſſion of her fault, he did fréely forgive her, and then ariſing from his Throne, he came down and took her by the hand, and raiſed her from the ground, and then cauſed the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> to ariſe, to whom he gave her, wiſhing the Gods to bleſs them.</p>
               <p>Thus this being done to the content of all that were preſent, the Souldan commanded the Tables to be covered, and deſired the ſtrangers to ſit down to Dinner, promiſing in the Afternoon to give them ſatisfaction in order to a general Peace.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NO ſooner was Dinner ended, but the Souldan entring into his Council Chamber, ſent for <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and <hi>Don Brianel,</hi> and told them, that ſince he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in his Daughters Marriage, which had béen the greateſt cauſe of theſe Wars, it ſhould be at their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe whether they would have Peace or War.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Souldan having underſtood formerly of the Affairs of that Kingdom, and that it was now in the poſſeſſion of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, granted the Requeſt of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> on condition that She and her Heirs would for the future pay the accuſtomed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, the which ſhe on her part promiſed to perform.

And to conclude all, promiſed a frée Pardon to the Kings of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Teſſifanty,</hi> who were his Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Whereupon <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and <hi>Don Brianel</hi> departed from the Souldan to carry this News to the Camp, where the Chief being aſſembled joyfully received the News, and for that

night made continual Bone-fires, ſo that both in the City and Camp it was all night as light as day.</p>
               <p>The next morning early a Meſſenger arrived in the Camp, to give an Invitation to the Emperor and the reſt of thoſe great Lords, to come into the City to dine with the Souldan: which Invitation was accepted of, and accordingly about Eleven of the Clock they all ſet forwards and ſo entred the City, being attended with great Ceremonies and Pomp by many of the Souldans Knights. As ſoon as they came near the Pallace, the Souldan had notice thereof and came to receive them, and although till now they had béen the greateſt enemies in all the world, yet the Souldan and the Emperor embraced one another with much fréedom and amity: And thus the Souldan received all the reſt of the principal Knights, and ſo conducted them into the Great Hall of the Pallace, where all things were provided for Dinner in moſt ſumptuous manner: which being ended, the Souldan and Emperor ratified and confirmed the Peace which had béen before concluded on: And to ſignifie his love to Duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> he then gave unto him the Kingdom of <hi>Shyraz,</hi> which was a place under his ſubjection and belonged to his Empire, and then the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> his wife were immediately owned by all for King and Quéen of <hi>Shyraz:</hi> Nothing was now wanting in the Court of <hi>Perſia</hi> to give it its full luſtre, but the preſence of the Prince <hi>Perianeo,</hi> whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence much diſcontented the Souldan.</p>
               <p>All things being thus fortunately concluded, the Souldan diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded his Army, and the Emperor ſent his away by Sea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of <hi>Sabian</hi> of <hi>Trebanto,</hi> who accordingly embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued himſelf, and within ten days departed: there was nothing now wanting, but to put the two Princeſſes in poſſeſſion of their Kingdoms, the Princeſs <hi>Aurora</hi> into her Kingdom of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> and her husband into poſſeſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Shyraz,</hi> for which purpoſe he writ Letters to the preſent Governor to give them poſſeſſion thereof; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Aurora</hi> deſired the company of ſome Knights to go with her; the firſt that offered his ſervice was <hi>Don Brianel,</hi> and then <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore</hi> of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly,</hi>

becauſe they had formerly béen there, deſired to attend her, and ſo did <hi>Contumeliano</hi> Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> and <hi>Floriſpiano</hi> of <hi>Swevia</hi> his Couſin, theſe all choſe to attend the Princeſs <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora:</hi> On the other ſide <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> deſired his Father to permit him to attend the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> and her Husband to <hi>Shyraz,</hi> and he choſe rather to go thither, becauſe it was née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where his beloved Princeſs did remain, and to which place he intended to go.

               <p>THe Sage <hi>Friſtone</hi> made ſuch haſte thorough the air with the wounded bodies of <hi>Perianeo</hi> and <hi>Gramalis,</hi> that in ſhort time they arrived at the end of their journey, where being arrived, the Sage <hi>Friſtone</hi> cauſed them (who were all this while in a Trance) to be taken out of the Charriot, and placed in beds in two ſeveral Rooms, and then commanded ſeveral Damſels to attend the end of their fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which they accordingly did: the Prince <hi>Perianeo</hi> was the firſt that came to himſelf, when opening his eyes and looking about him, he fetched a great groan, the Damſel who were left to attend him, hearing thereof, preſently came to him, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes open, they preſently gave him ſomething to drink out of a Vial, which he took, and then with a weak voice asked them in what place he was? They deſired him to reſt ſatisfied for the preſent, and he ſhould know more of that hereafter, and in the mean time they deſired him to permit them to dreſs his wounds, to which he conſented, and they preſently being very skilful in that myſtery, applyed ſuch Remedies that they aſſured him that in few days he ſhould be able to walk about his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and they further deſired him for the preſent to diſpoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for reſt, which he did accordingly, and they departed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Sage <hi>Friſtone</hi> thereof, who was marvellouſly well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in what they had done.</p>

Thus lay he muſing and wondring with himſelf what place he was in, ſometime believing all that he ſaw to be onely fancy, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while ſuppoſing himſelf to be in his Fathers Court laid out for dead in ſome Chamber there: and this he was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to by reaſon of the blackneſs of every thing about him.</p>
               <p>At length two Damſels entred the Room at a door placed in a corner thereof, they were both habited in black, the one carried a Candle in her hand, and the other followed her with a Box wherein were Ointments and Plaiſters: coming to the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide they found him awake, and in pretty good condition. He ſéeing them continue their ſilence, began thus to them: Ladies, I have received one kindneſs from you already, for which I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you thanks, and deſire you to binde me to you for another, which is, that you will tell me in what place I am, and how I came hither</p>
               <p>The Ladies hearing him ſpeak with ſo great moderation, gave him this Anſwer: Sir Knight, how you came hither we know not, but yeſterday you were brought in hither by the Lord of this place, whoſe name is <hi>Friſtone,</hi> and delivered to our kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, telling us that we muſt apply theſe Medicines to your wounds, ſhewing us likewiſe that you were ſuch a perſon as was very well able to requite what kindneſs we ſhould afford you: As for the name of this place we cannot tell you, for it is not long ſince we were brought hither by an adventure, of which we ſhall tell you more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thus after they had ended their diſcourſe, they deſired him

to permit them to ſearch his wounds, which he conſented to, and they, after they had applyed remedies to his wounds, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, leaving him ſomewhat better ſatisfied than he was.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe two Knights continued in this place ſeveral days, till at length they were ſo well recovered of their wounds, that they could walk about their Chambers.

               <p>Reverend Father, many have béen the obligations wherein you have bound your poor Knight, but this laſt hath béen the moſt conſiderable, in that you have given help and aſsiſtance to me when I was not capable of helping my ſelf: and good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have now but one requeſt to you which I pray you to grant me, which is that you will tell me by what adventure I came hither, and what was the iſſue of the Combat.</p>
               <p>To which diſcourſe <hi>Friſtone</hi> thus anſwered, Sir Knight, it was not of a long time unknown to me of the Battel that you and your friends ſhould undertake againſt the Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> his ſon, and friends, and of the danger that you ſhould undergo therein, which I endeavored to prevent by my Art, but your enemy <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> by reaſon of a Sword and Armor which he hath lately won, cannot be hindred from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any adventure, notwithſtanding all the art of incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that I can uſe, wherefore finding it in vain to attempt any thing by art to hurt him, I therefore applyed my ſelf to help you when there ſhould be occaſion, and underſtanding that your life, and that of two of your friends would be in great danger, and knowing that by my art I ſhould be able to help your ſelf and one other of your friends, I therefore provided me
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55264:23"/>
a Chariot, in which I mounted the air at ſuch time as you and your friends were entred the Combat, and arrived at the place of your fight, juſt as it had like to have béen unfortunately fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; for <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was juſt then about to deprive you of your precious life, and then he recounted to him, how he found him in the field in a Trance, and how that <hi>Gramalis</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Caroliano</hi> being in as deſperate a condition as himſelf, he choſe <hi>Gramalis</hi> and left the other, and brought both himſelf and <hi>Gramalis</hi> to that his habitation, where he had ordered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo well, that they were in pretty good condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perianeo</hi> much wondering at this adventure, ſaid: But good father, how will the Souldan my Father be ſatisfied with my condition? Then <hi>Friſtone</hi> told him of the Pillar he left there, and the inſcription thereon, which had given ſatisfaction to him, and therefore adviſed him to reſt contented; and ſo taking him by the hand he led him out of that Chamber into another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, which was as dark as his own, and there they found <hi>Gramalis</hi> of <hi>Thrace</hi> walking about: <hi>Perianeo</hi> was not ſo much amazed to ſée him, as <hi>Gramalis</hi> was ſurprized to ſée the Prince enter his Chamber, for he knew not in the leaſt where he was; for his wounds being ſomewhat more deſperate then <hi>Perianeo's, Friſtone</hi> had commanded thoſe that attended him, not to uſe any diſcourſe with him, leſt that ſhould prejudice his health. They being thus met, kindely ſaluted each other, and then <hi>Perianeo</hi> recounted to <hi>Gramalis</hi> the manner how they were brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the danger they had béen in, and the care of which <hi>Friſtone</hi> had taken of their healths, for which they both kindly returned him thanks. Thus theſe two friends being together, <hi>Friſtone</hi> left them in loving communication, and went to take order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his other affairs.</p>
               <p>They had not long walked together, but the two Damſels that had attended them in their ſickneſs, came in to them, and brought with them ſeveral Comfits and preſerved Fruits and Wines, wherewith they covered a Table and cauſed the two Knights to ſit down to ear, which they did, and then the Table being removed, <hi>Perianeo</hi> taking one of the Damſels by the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55264:24"/>
hand, led her to the Bed-ſide where he thus ſpake to her.</p>
               <p>Lady, my condition hath béen ſo low of late, that I have béen very much obliged to your care and pains, that I am now in ſo good a plight, for which your great care I render you all humble and hearty thanks, aſſuring you that when ever you have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to uſe me, you ſhall finde that there ſhall be nothing ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, but I will be ready to undertake it with exceeding great pleaſure, ſo that I may ſerve you therein, and therefore Lady I beſeech you inform me of your condition, and the place where I now remain. The Damſel perceiving that he had concluded, thus anſwered him: Sir Knight, I humbly thank you for your acceptance of my mean and weak endeavors, and am glad that any thing that I can do will give you any pleaſure, and to the end that I may ſatisfie your deſires, know Sir, that I belong to an honorable Princeſs called <hi>Merediana</hi> ſole daughter and heir to the valiant King <hi>Gorgiana</hi> of <hi>Sotia,</hi> who living at home with her father, was taken out of her Court one day by the Sage <hi>Friſtone,</hi> who deſired her father to ſpare her, to put an end to an Adventure that could not be finiſhed without her preſence: her father well knowing the Sage <hi>Friſtone</hi> to be his friend, conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her departure, and ſo ſhe taking ſix of her Damſels with her, whereof I and my companion are two, we travelled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Babylon,</hi> where when we arrived, the ſage <hi>Friſtone</hi> told us that his deſign was to get the beauteous Princeſs <hi>Floris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> into his cuſtody, whereby he might pleaſure a Knight his very good friend; which adventure he had accompliſhed, but that there arrived at that inſtant a Knight armed with a rich armor, beſet with Baſilisks, who hindred our attempt: then told ſhe the Prince the whole manner of his adventure, as it is at large ſet down in the <hi>42</hi> Chapter of the firſt part of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and then ſhe thus procéeded: We being thus hindred from finiſhing this adventure, were immediately carried through the air till we arrived at an Iſland, where when we came down, we found it to be the moſt pleaſant place in the whole world, for it was adorned with a moſt delightſome Pallace, and all manner of Gardens and Walks ſo delicious, that we having béen there above ſix months, are not ſenſible of my inclemency
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55264:24"/>
in the air, but it ſtill continues as pleaſant if it were the month of <hi>May,</hi> and it is now about a fortnight ſince the ſage <hi>Friſtone</hi> coming thither, requeſted our Miſtreſs to give us leave to go with him for a few days, promiſing that ſhe ſhould receive much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in our journey, and that we ſhould ſpéedily return: and as for the place where now we are, we know other of it but that it is called <hi>the Deſart of Death,</hi> and indéed it may properly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be termed ſo, for I never was in any place ſo doleſome and melancholly as this is, there being no other light coming into this place but what a candle produeth, and the fields, which are but few, look as if no Graſs nor any other Herb had ever grown there, and there are no trées but <hi>Yew</hi> grow here. This Sir Knight, is all that I can tell you of this adventure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gramalis</hi> of <hi>Thrace</hi> had likewiſe béen attentive to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and they did both much marvel at the ſtrangeneſs of the Damſels recital, but <hi>Perianeo</hi> asked the Damſel how far off it was to that pleaſant Iſland where her Lady remained, and what company was with her? To which ſhe anſwered, That it could not be very far to that Iſland, for they were but thrée hours in coming from thence, and that their Princeſs was onely accompanied with a Lady named <hi>Altea,</hi> who they found there, and which was very fair and beautiful, and the four Giants who kept the Pallace as a guard, beſides the Damſels who waited on the two Ladies, and two old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who provided all manner of proviſion Thus theſe two Damſels having finiſhed their diſcourſe, they took their leaves of the two Knights and departed.</p>

He had no ſooner blown the horn which hung by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55264:26"/>
the Tablet, but two gates opened, and there iſſued out from thence a huge and monſtrous Giant, armed at all points, with a great Iron Mace in his hand, who ſéeing the Knight before him, ſaid: Preſumptuous villain, how dareſt thou unarmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo great an enterprize, as to diſturb the quiet of this place?</p>
               <p>To which <hi>Gramalis</hi> anſwered, Trouble not thy ſelf at my being unarmed, but if I muſt combat thee before I gain my entrance, prepare thy ſelf to the Battel, and defend thy ſelf: at which words the Giant lifted up the Mace, and came forward thinking with one blow to end the Battel, but <hi>Gramalis</hi> quickly avoiding the ſtroke of the Mace with his Hunting-ſpear, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Giant in the Thigh, and at the next ſtroke gave him ſo great a blow on the arm, that he could not draw out his ſpear, but was forced to leave it ſticking there: whilſt the Giant drew the Spear from his arm, <hi>Don Gramalis</hi> drew his Sword, and went to finiſh the combat: but the enraged Giant did hit the Knight ſo great a blow on the ſhoulder, that he ſorely bruiſed him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Gramalis</hi> being greatly enraged, gave the Giant ſo great a blow on the other arm, that he let fall his Mace and roared like a Bull, and with the quantity of blood he loſt, fell down: at which a Dwarf that was placed on the top of the Tower, blew a horn, and immediately another Giant came forth, more deformed and horrible then the firſt, who reſolved to revenge the wrong of his fellow and therefore ſoon made up to <hi>Gramalis</hi> and aſſaulted him moſt fiercely, giving him many wounds, ſo that in the end <hi>Gramalis</hi> through the want of blood, and the pain he felt in his ſide, fainted and fell down. At which the Giant went forwards to kill him, but <hi>Perianeo</hi> ſoon prevented him, aſſaulting him in ſuch marvellous manner, that he made him kéep company with his fellow on the ground; at which the Dwarf once more ſounded his horn, and then there iſſued two Giants of a very great ſize, who carried great Maces on their ſhoulders, and cutting Faulchions at their ſides, and without any diſcourſe they both fell upon the Prince, and gave him many weighty blows, which he received on his Spear; but in the end that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken he drew his ſword, and valiantly defended himſelf, ſtill
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55264:26"/>
avoiding their blows, and dammaging his adverſaries, ſo that they ſéeing that they onely beat the air, or the ground, were much enraged and came neer to him to deſtroy him, but he nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſlepping within them, made them loſs their blowes, and he hit one of them on the leg ſo great a blow, that he made a great wound, and the Giant not being able to ſtand, fell on the earth, whereupon the other Giant his companion ſéeing that if he continued that manner of fighting, he ſhould remain vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as well as his companions, he threw away his Mace, and ran with great eagerneſs on the Knight, thinking to catch him in his arms, and there to ſqueeze him in pieces: but he being very ſtrong, ſorely wounded the Giant before he got within him, and then wreſtled ſo with him, that they both fell to the earth, the Giant holding <hi>Perianeo</hi> cloſe in his arms; but he remembering that he had a dagger in his pocket, quickly drew the ſame and ſtabbed him in thrée or four places in ſuch manner, that he let go his hold, whereat <hi>Perianeo</hi> got on his féet, though ſorely wounded, and approached to the Gates of the Caſtle, which being open he entred, and walking thorough a great Hall he went into a Parlor, the moſt beautiful in the world, where he ſaw two Ladies who were placed above the reſt, and about twelve Damſels attending on them, to whom he ſaid:</p>

               <p>To which ſpéech one of the Ladies replyed, That indéed the Giants were placed there as Guardians of that place, but ſince by his invincible vallor they were ſubdued, he was as welcome as themſelves, and all things there was frée to his diſpoſal: at which ſpéech he reſted ſatisfied, onely he deſired that he wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55264:27"/>
might be taken care of, and more eſpecially a Knight who was wounded, and a friend of his: At which diſcourſe ſeveral of the Damſels went out with him, where they found the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and the Knight ſtill lying on the ground, wherefore he helped to convey them to Beds, and the Damſels applyed ſuch Plaiſters and Medicines to their wounds, that in ſhort time they were cured of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Being cured, the Gyants and Knights remained loving friends, reſolving to aſſiſt each other, and the Knights had no deſire to go from that place, for the Ladies whom they ſaw were the two Princeſſes <hi>Meridiana</hi> and <hi>Altea,</hi> who took very great good liking to the two Knights <hi>Perianeo</hi> and <hi>Gramalis,</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them as well, ſo that in the end their friendſhip arrived to that height, that they reſolved never to leave one another all days of their lives: and the Prince <hi>Perianeo</hi> was ſo amorous of the Princeſs <hi>Meridiana,</hi> that he quite forget the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and ſhe no leſs loved him, ſo that at length he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Princeſs as fully as if ſhe had béen his Wife, and ſhe permitted him to crop that Maiden-flower, and enter that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Zone, which had coſt the lives of many valorous Knights.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Gramalis</hi> of <hi>Thrace</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Altea</hi> loved each other with as ſond an affection, and ſhe permitted him to be Lord of her body, and to take ſuch fruit from thence as pleaſed him beſt.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe two Ladies and Knights lived together in all manner of delight, and the two Knights plyed themſelves ſo well in their Nocturnal Embraces, that both the Princeſſes were with Childe, which was great joy and content to them all: in which pleaſure we ſhall leave them, and return to give you an account of other Adventures.</p>

               <p>THus having left theſe two Princes and Ladies in all content and pleaſure, let us return to the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> and the Company that attended on her, who travelled many days without happening on any Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: at length <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being very penſive, travelled one day before the reſt of the company, and being very melancholly for the thought of his dear Miſtreſs the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> on a ſudden he heard a voice call to him, ſaying, Sir Knight, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéech you tell me where is the next City, that I may go quickly to it and procure ſome aid to ſome perſons of great quality that ſtand in néed of help. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> giving attention to this diſcourſe, and ſéeing it was a Lady that ſpake to him, he thus replyed: Fair Lady, if you be not in extream great haſte, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéech you relate to me the occaſion of your travel, it is poſſible that I may furniſh you with that aſſiſtance you expect. Ah Sir
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55264:28"/>
Knight, replyed the Lady, it is not in the power of any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Knight to effect that which muſt be done; therefore good Sir either anſwer me the queſtion, or permit me to go forwards. Lady, ſaid <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> not far from hence there is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany coming who will be with us preſently, therefore I pray relate to me your buſineſs while they come to us, and then I ſhall furniſh you with ſuch help as ſhall be néedful. The Lady underſtanding that he ſpake nothing but reaſon, thus replyed: Know then, Sir Knight, that I belong to the vertuous Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and Niece to the Souldan of <hi>Babylon:</hi> this Princeſs hath for many years li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Court of the Souldan her Vncle, in the company of the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> her Couſin, but of late her Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown old, and deſirous to diſpoſe of her in marriage before he died, ſent her Brother <hi>Baltaſano</hi> to the Court of the Souldan to bring his Siſter to him: <hi>Baltaſano</hi> after he had continued ſome time in the Court of the Souldan, deſired leave to depart with his Siſter to her Father that expected them; to which it was a long time ere he could get the Souldans conſent, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great love that hath béen betwéen her and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Florisbella.</hi> About two moneths ſince there was great Iouſts and Tournaments held at the Souldans Court in honor of his Coronation Day: at which time many ſtrange Knights and Gyants repaired thither to do their utmoſt devoirs, amongſt the reſt that came, there was one Gyant called <hi>Altifer the Proud,</hi> Lord of an Iſland in the Sea, and his two Brothers, and forty Knights. This Gyant beholding my Miſtreſs the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> began to affect her, and performed ſome things for her honor, hoping thereby to get her good will: but ſhe who always hated him, as well for the deformity of his mind as body, would by no means conſent to come into his company, much leſs to receive him as a Servant, and he having deſired her of her Vncle the Souldan, and her Brother, who both refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, went away with all his company in much diſcontent, reſolving to put in practiſe ſome treaſonable action that he might obtain her.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55264:28"/>
ſome time after he was gone, having taken leave of the Souldan and the Prindeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> departed in the company of twenty Knights for their Guard: but we had not travelled above two days when this Traytor <hi>Altifer</hi> with all his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſet upon us, ſlew many of our Knights, and took the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and her Brother priſoners.

               <p>IT was yet but early in the morning when <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Company parted, and therefore we will leave them in their Iourney towards <hi>Shyraz,</hi> to tell you what befel <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> who travelled ſo long with the Damſel that at laſt they arrived in ſight of a Caſtle ſeated on a Rock, which when the Damſel eſpied, ſhe ſaid, Sir Knight, this is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle where the Gyants and the other company lodged this night, and I believe they are not as yet come out of it, becauſe he that is Lord of this Caſtle is of kinred to the Gyant <hi>Altifer,</hi> and therefore I pray let us attend herefor their coming forth. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> therefore adviſing with himſelf, left two of his knights to attend there, whileſt he and the reſt travelled on the way the Gyants were to take, and there they hid themſelves in a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Trées.</p>
               <p>It was not fully an hour before the two Knights came gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping a main to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> informing him that the Gyants and their company were come out of the Caſtle, and were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither-wards with the priſoners. The Prince <hi>Baltaſano</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:55264:29"/>
they tyed on a horſe with his hands behinde him, and ſo they did to about twelve Knights more that were priſoners, and the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> and ſeveral of her Damſels, were carried before certain Knights on horſeback, and did make great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
               <p>The Knights did likewiſe adviſe <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> not to ſet on the Gyants and their company as yet, for that the Gyant of the Caſtle where they lay was come out with them, with above twenty Knights to bear them company a little way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was beſt to forbear ſetting on them till they were gone: To this adviſe <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> could hardly be perſwaded, ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt was his deſire to do ſome ſignal Service for his Lady the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella;</hi> but in the end he was over-ruled by the Damſel, and promiſed to attend their parting for an hour or two, and if they did not by that time leave one another, that he would ſet upon them all. And in this reſolution he marched forwards, commanding the two Knights to go back and give him notice of what ſhould happen, which was done aecordingly. Thus did <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> march on for one hour in great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till at length the two Knights came to him to inform him that now was the time, for the Gyants kinſman was departed, and there was not above thirty five Knights and thrée Gyants, and ten of the Knights were employed in guarding of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners that were with them.</p>
               <p>Never was <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſo well pleaſed in all his life as he was at this inſtant, and therefore commanding all his Knights to be in a readineſs, he turned back his horſe, and went to méet the Gyants and their Company. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> had not rid far before he met with them, the two Gyants brothers to <hi>Altifer,</hi> riding before the reſt on great Horſes, and with Iron Maces hanging at their Sadle-bows. Our Knights went ſtraight up to them, and ſome of the Princeſſes Damſels making a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> enquired what was the cauſe why they forced Ladies to go with them againſt their wills? To which one of the Gyants proudly anſwered, It were beſt for you, Sir Knight, to kéep on your way, and not to meddle with the affairs of others, not being called thereto. To which he anſwered,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55264:30"/>
That he and all other Knights were bound to enquire into the affairs of diſtreſſed Ladies, and to relieve them to their power Whereupon one of the Giants laid hold on his Mace, thinking to daſh him to pieces, but he turning his horſe on one ſide, couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lance and run ſo fiercely on the other Giant, that he forced him to meaſure his length on the earth, at whoſe example all the reſt of the company did the like, and they performed their parts ſo well, that ſixtéen Knights and two Giants were diſmounted, and ſix were ſlain out right.</p>
               <p>The Giant <hi>Altifer</hi> ſéeing himſelf ſo beſet, preſently couched his lance and did ſome miſchief: But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſoon hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him from procéeding, for he reached him ſuch a ſtroke that he made his horſe bend his knées to the ground, and his Maſter catch hold of his horſe neck to kéep himſelf from falling, and then crying <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and Victory, he gave two ſuch mighty ſtrokes to two Knights that ſtood in his way, that he ſent them tumbling to the earth, and then coming to the Prince <hi>Baltaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> be immediately unbound him, and gave him a Sword, by whoſe example the reſt of his Knights releaſed the reſt of the priſoners, and then began the fight to be moſt bloody.</p>
               <p>The Giant <hi>Altifer,</hi> and his two brothers ſéeing the vallor of that one Knight, reſolved to ſet upon him, and ſo they all thrée came with the ſame reſolution, but he quickly ſéeing the danger he was likely to run into, if he did not diſpatch, gave one of them ſo powerful a blow, that he cut off his Arm, and forced him to let his Mace fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>The two brothers ſéeing this, came with both their Maces at once, intending to beat him to pieces; but <hi>Baltaſano</hi> who he had unbound having gotten a Sword, Buckler and Helmet, received one of them, and gave him in return ſo puiſſant a ſtroke, that he cut off one of his armes and wounded him in the ſhoulder: the enraged Giants did all they could to revenge the wounds they had received, and <hi>Altifer</hi> himſelf ſéeing that he was likely to loſs his Miſtriſs, left the combat, and coming to the Knight that had the Princeſs in guard before him, and took her and ſet her on his own horſe before him, and did ride away with all the ſpéed poſsible: at which action the Damſels gave a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55264:30"/>
great ſcréetch, which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> hearing much wondred, and leaving the fight, turned himſelf about: but he had no ſooner perceived the cauſe, but like lightning he made haſte after him, and being very well mounted, he ſoon overtook him, which the Giant ſéeing, he let fall the Lady, and turned about to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> being glad that he had gotten him alone, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was no leſs glad then he, not onely for that, but alſo in regard that he had let go the Princeſs, fearing much that if he had held her ſtill ſhe might have béen hurt in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Thus theſe two Combatants equally reſolved, aſſaulted each other, and gave and received many wounds; but <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> whoſe valor was not to be equalled by any Giant or Knight, reſolving now in the preſence of his Ladies kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſhew the utmoſt effects thereof, gave the Giant two ſuch mighty blows, that with the one he cut off his leg, and with the other he quite killed him.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs all this while beholding the combat, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mighty blows <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> gave the Giant, could not imagine who it ſhould be, and that ſo much worth and ſtrength ſhould remain in one ſingle Knight, but well viewing his arms, ſhe remembred him to be <hi>the Knight of the Baſilisks,</hi> who had done ſuch brave acts at <hi>Babylon</hi> for the relief of her Couſin the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and viewing her Picture on his ſhield, ſhe immediately cried out, Ah worthy Knight! pattern of all true Valor and Magnanimity, much am I bound to you for your great aid and aſsiſtance, and many thanks have I cauſe to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you for this ſo mighty deliverance in this my moſt extream neceſſity: Having thus ſaid, ſhe came néer him to kiſs his hands, but he refuſed that and kindly embracing her, ſaid: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, it is time for us to return back to ſée in what condition the Prince your brother is, and if occaſion be to lend him my aſsiſtance: wherefore he cauſed her to mount on the Giants horſe, and he mounting on his own, ſet forwards towards the place of the combat; in which time ſhe again thanked him for the aid he had afforded her, promiſing him to do him all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of love or friendſhip that ſhe could, if he would pleaſe to come to the Souldan of <hi>Babylons</hi> Paace as he had formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55264:31"/>
telling him that ſhe was now reſolved to return back thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſſuring him that the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> her Couſin had an extraordinary eſtéem for him, and expected his coming: and ſhe aſſured him, that ſhe would endeavor to increaſe her good affection towards him.</p>
               <p>Much joyed was <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> at this diſcourſe, and thus they arrived at the place of combat, where the two Giants and all their Knights were either ſlain or vanquiſhed: Thus was this fight happily ended to the eternal honor of <hi>Don Bellianis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Damſels of the Princeſs preſently applyed ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the wounds of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> his Knights, and then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one mounting his horſe, they rid on: the Prince <hi>Baltaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> was very thankful for this aſsiſtance, and promiſed <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> an eternal friendſhip; thus they rode on together ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, till at length the Princeſs her brother were reſolved not to procéed in their journey with ſo ſlight a guard, but to go back to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to which place they invited <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> who made his excuſes for the preſent, promiſing them that within a moneth he would not fail to wait upon them there: and thus after many ſeveral diſcourſes, they coming to a way that went towards <hi>Babylon,</hi> they took their leaves of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and parted thither-wards, leaving him and his Knights to travel to the City of <hi>Shyraz</hi> to méet with the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana,</hi> and Duke <hi>Alfiron.</hi>

                  <hi>DOn Bellianis</hi> and his Knights travelled ſo faſt, that within thrée hours after they overtook their company, for the Princeſs and her Husband made but eaſie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and had ſtayed at a Town not far off to dinner: When <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> came before the Duke and the Princeſs, they asked him how he had ſped in his Enterprize? whereupon he gave them ſuch an account, that they reſted very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55264:31"/>
they were now come within two leagues of <hi>Shyraz,</hi> and many of the Nobility had already come to them to give them the welcome, which they thankfully received.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>After they had paſſed the <hi>Tapyrian</hi> Mountains, they came to a great River called <hi>Bradamir,</hi> which watereth the City, and afterwards falleth into the <hi>Perſian Gulph</hi> with twenty miles circling about on the land: when they came near the City, it was the pleaſanteſt thing in the world to behold, ſo ſtately a Building, twenty ſtately Temples appeared at one time, and the Pallace with its lofty Towers made an extraordinary ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in the eyes of the ſpectators. Infinite was the reſort of the Plebeans that came out to behold their New King and Quéen, and when they were a mile off from the City, the Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates came out to do their homage to the King and Quéen, and in this manner they entred the City, which is one of moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and famous throughout all that part of the World. Here Art Magick was firſt hatched. Here <hi>Nimrod,</hi> after the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> lived and was buried.

Here the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> glutted his ambition and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs. Here the firſt <hi>Sybilla</hi> ſung our Saviors Incarnation.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55264:32"/>
Hence the <hi>Magi</hi> are thought to ſet forth toward <hi>Bethelem,</hi> and here many Kings have ſwayed their Scepters: in fine, it is a place defended by nature, inricht by trade, by art made lovely, the Vineyards, Gardens, Cypreſſes, and Temples, raviſh the eye, and ſmell in every part ſwéet and delightful.</p>
               <p>Theſe excellent perſons were received into this moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome place, with a great deal of ſolemnity and joy, and in all the principal places of that City, and all other places of the nation, they were immediately Proclaimed King and Quéen of <hi>Shyra z, Lar,</hi> and <hi>Jaarown,</hi> Lord and Lady of <hi>Ormis, Maque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon, Kermoen, Chuſeſtam, Sigeſtan,</hi> and <hi>Farſeſtan,</hi> Prince and Princeſs of the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and of the Iſles there. Theſe were the titles, and great was the joy and acclamations of all that vaſt kingdom, which reaches above ſix hundred miles round about. If I ſhould recite to you the many ſhews, pageants, and triumphant arches that were built, and the ſeveral congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Spéeches that were that day made to their new King and Quéen, I ſhould as much weary you with the reading, and my ſelf with the writing thereof, as they were that day wearied with the hearing of them, and indeed they were ſo tedious, that although they came to the City by two of the clock after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, yet was it nine of the clock at night before they came to the pallace: whither they being arrived, they diſmiſſed moſt of their ſubjects, and being much wearied they went to take their ordinary repoſe, which thorough wearineſs every one enjoyed, except <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> whoſe deſires were wholly fixed on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Florisbella,</hi> from whoſe preſence he had béen ſo long abſent, that he was in great doubt of his reception into her ſervice, but the promiſe that day made him by the Princeſs <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taroſa,</hi> did ſomewhat conſolate his diſturbed fancy. Thus ſpent he the whole night in continued contemplations till day appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he roſe and went to ſalute the King and Quéen, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſought them ſince he had ſéen them ſafely received into their kingdom, they would be pleaſed to give him leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part about his more weighty affairs. This diſcourſe much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them, hoping that they ſhould enjoy his company for a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſeaſon, but ſince he was ſo deſire us to be gone, they prayed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55264:32"/>
him that he would do them ſo much honor as to ſtay ten days longer, in which time they intended to be Crowned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> not well knowing how to deny any thing to perſons ſo, bliging, conſented to this Requeſt, provided that as ſoon as the Solemnity was ended, they would no longer deſire to detain him from his other Adventures: To which they both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves, and thereupon that day the King iſſued forth his Commands to all perſons concerned to repair to the Court on that day ſeven-night, to aſſiſt at the Ceremonies which were accuſtomed at the Coronation, with free liberty for all Knights, as well Chriſtians as Pagans, to go and come at the ſame time, and during their ſtay to ſhew their Valor and Manhood in Tilting, Iouſting, and all other Knighty Exerciſes. This Proclamation being ſent abroad occaſioned many knights to reſort to the Court, ſo that by the time prefixed for the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, as well the fields adjoyning to the City, as the City it ſelf, was filled with Knights, ſo that it was a moſt delectable ſight to behold, and moſt delicious to hear the ſound of ſo many Warlike Inſtruments as was at that time heard. And the King cauſed certain Earls to be made on the out-ſide of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, within which the Knights were to Tilt and perform their Déeds of Knighthood, and cauſed a Throne to be placed there for himſelf and his Quéen, and Seats for the reſt of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, where they might ſit and ſée the Tournaments: and he further ordained twenty Knights of his own, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by one <hi>Don Lorino</hi> Son to his Brother <hi>Don Gorino,</hi> a young and hardy Knight, to reſiſt all ſtrange Knights.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus ordained, all people waited with a great deal of impatience, till the appointed day for the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Conoration was come; which day being now come, there happened that which ſhall be declared in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Day of the Coronation being come, there entred into the Court a Knight, who termed himſelf to be <hi>The Knight of the Iſland of Pearls,</hi> and demanded the Kingdom of <hi>Shyraz</hi> as his right, and offered to defend his Title in ſingle Combate againſt any one Knight; which Combate <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and vanquiſhed him, and of his departure for <hi>Babylon.</hi>

               </argument>
               <figure/>
               <p>THe Kingdom of <hi>Shyraz,</hi> whereof the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Perſiana</hi> were now in poſſeſſion, had for many years belonged to the Souldan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Princeſs, who had given the ſame to his Daughter, as hath already béen declared: but we have not yet told you how the Souldan of <hi>Perſia</hi> came by the ſame.</p>
               <p>So it was, that the Father of this Souldan onely had tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute for the ſame of one <hi>Gozmin,</hi> a valiant Knight, but the ſaid <hi>Gozmin</hi> for ſome trayterous enterprize was diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſeſſed of the ſame: He being executed, and his ſons for ever diſenabled to poſſeſs the ſame, for a juſt reward of their fathers treaſon, and then the Souldan took the ſame into his own poſſeſſion, and ever
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55264:33"/>
after that took the immediate Profits thereof to his own uſe, onely appointing a Governor there, whom he placed and diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as often as he thought fit, and in this condition he left it to his Son when he died, who (as I told you) gave it fréely to his Son in Law Duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> as a Portion with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now this <hi>Gozmin</hi> left two Sons behinde him, both vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and ſtout Knights, the eldeſt whereof lived in an Iſland in the <hi>Perſian Gulph,</hi> called <hi>The Iſland of Pearls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The day being come wherein this great Ceremony of Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King and Quéen was to be performed, every one aroſe early either to aſſiſt at, or behold the Ceremony: The King and Quéen being ready, mounted in a Triumphant Chariot, and by four Vnicorns were drawn to the great Temple, where they being arrived mounted on a Scaffold prepared to that purpoſe, and then the Chief <hi>Flamin</hi> of the City, after the ordinary Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, placed two Crowns of Gold, enriched with many precious Stones of ineſtimable value on their heads, praying to the Gods to bleſs them with perpetual bleſſings, and bleſſing all their friends, and true and loyal Subjects, and curſing all ſuch as were, or ſhould be their enemies. This Ceremony being performed, they both deſcended from their Thrones, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the Temple remounted their Chariot, riding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in through the City with their Crowns on to the Court, where they were no ſooner arrived, but the Tables were ſpread with all manner of delicious Viands that the Countrey could afford, many Healths going round the Table for the proſperity of the King and Quéen. After Dinner was ended, before any perſon did ariſe from Table, the Herald at Arms (according to cuſtom did, after the ſound of an innumerable company of Trumpets) again proclaim the ſaid Duke and Princeſs to be King and Quéen of <hi>Shyraz, Larr</hi> and <hi>Jaarown,</hi> Lord and Lady of <hi>Ormus, Maqueroone, Kermoen, Chuſeſtan, Sigeſtan</hi> and <hi>Farfeſtan,</hi> Prince and Princeſs of the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and of the Iſles there.</p>
               <p>Theſe words he pronounced twice, and at the end of every ſuch Proclamation he ſaid, if any one had any right to the ſame, or any part thereof, he bid them come forth and declare the ſame.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55264:34"/>
This had béen done twice, and the <hi>Herald</hi> was about to begin the third time, when a Knight armed in an azure Armor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to hold his peace; which he obeyed, and then the Knight going up to the place, where the King and Quéen ſat, ſpake as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duke Alfiron, <hi>for by no other name ſhall I own you: It is not unknown to moſt of the people here preſent, that my Title to this Crown of</hi> Shyraz, <hi>and all the Territories thereto belonging, is juſt and good, when they ſhall know that I am Son to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> Gozmin, <hi>ſometimes King of this place, I had long ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the Souldan would have reſtored me to my undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted right, but ſince I ſee that he hath been ſo unjuſt as to give it away, I am to tell thee, that if thou wilt enjoy it, I muſt firſt be dead; and therefore I will thee preſently to appoint at thy Champion to defend thy Title, and to enter into the Liſts with me immediately, not queſtioning but the Gods will ſo far do me iuſtice, that I ſhall be enabled to deſtroy thy Champion.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus ſaid, he held his peace: This Spéech gave a wonderful aſtoniſhment to all the perſons there preſent, and gave the King and Queen a ſenſible trouble to be thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the midſt of their Solemnity. The King anſwered, That he was ſo well ſatisfied in the Iuſtice of the Quarrel, that he was ready himſelf to enter the Field to vindicate his Right, but the Queen diſwaded him therefrom, not queſtioning but that they ſhould finde ſome other Champion.</p>
               <p>Many Knights preſently aroſe, and deſired the King and Queen that they might have the Honor of the Combate, but the King was reſolved not to venture his Title in the hands of any, but ſuch a one as he ſhould be very confident of his worth. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> thinking himſelf obliged to do ſomewhat, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to undertake the Combate, and therefore ariſing from his ſeat, deſired the King and Queen to admit him to be their Champion, and to put the trial of their Cauſe into his hands. The King would willingly have excuſed it, by reaſon of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obligations which he had already received from him: but <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> who was reſolved not to be denyed, preſſed them ſo hard, that at length they condeſcended. Whereupon he deſired
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55264:34"/>
that the Combate might preſently be performed. To which the other Knight willingly conſented, and the place intended for the Iouſts, was the place appointed for the Combate; to which place every one preſently repaired, much wondring at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Knight of <hi>the Iſland of Pearls,</hi> for ſo he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and was known to be the beſt Knight in all that Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having Armed himſelf, preſently repaired to the place appointed for the Combate, where when he came, be found the Knight of <hi>the Iſland of Pearls,</hi> and the King and Queen, and moſt of the Nobility ſeated near the Liſts, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this Combate. Both the Combatants were armed with very good Armor. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being armed with that famous Armor enriched with Baſilisks, and his Shield whereon was the Picture of the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and mounted on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Horſe. The other Knight was as well armed and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when taking each of them a Launce, at the ſound of the Trumpets they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uched their Launces, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> with the great deſire he had to hit his enemy, miſſed his encounter: but the other Knight did not ſo, but hit his enemy ſo firmly on the Shield, that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> loſt both his Stirrops; whereat he was ſo extreamly enraged, that throwing away his Launce without making any uſe thereof, he drew his Sword, which his enemy likewiſe did, and gave <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> a mighty blow on the Helm.</p>
               <p>The Knight of <hi>the Iſland of Pearls</hi> having given his enemy two ſuch notable ſtrokes without receiving any, did certainly aſſure himſelf of the better of the Combate: but was quickly of another minde, when <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being throughly enraged, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his Sword, gave the Knight ſo mighty a blow, that he tumbled him down from his Horſe: But he ſoon recovered his Legs and Sword, and went on to kill the horſe of his enemy; which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing, he quickly diſmounted and aſſaulted his enemy with many ſtrokes, which were returned with great ſtrength. During the time of this Combate with the Knights, their Horſes began a fierce Combate, for they ran violently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another, and lifting up their fore féet wounded each other, and what that could not do, they performed with their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55264:35"/>
téeth, biting one another in marvellous manner, to the great aſtoniſhment of the Beholders. Thus continued they a good while, but in the end <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> his Horſe cauſed the other to run away, which was taken notice of to be a good Omen to his Maſter, who in the mean time was not idle: But reſolving ſo ſoon as this Combate was finiſhed to be gone, therefore he did his utmoſt endeavor to vanquiſh his enemy, whom he had ſo wounded in ſeveral places, that it was impoſſible for him to continue much longer. But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being much vexed at the rediouſneſs of the Fight, lifting his Sword very high, gave the Knight ſo great a ſtroke on the Helm, that he cut it in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and wounded his head in ſuch manner that he fell to the earth, when preſently ſetting the point of his Sword to his Breaſt, be asked him if he would acknowledge the King and Quéen to be his lawful Sovereigns? To which the Knight replyed, He would never conſent to any ſuch thing during his life. Whereupon <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> without any more ado, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cut off his Head, and then he went to the Herauld, and commanded him to go forward with his Proclamation, which he accordingly did in open field, with the general acclamations of many thouſands of people who were there preſent.</p>
               <p>Thus this Combate being ended, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> went to the King and Quéen, and deſired them to give him leave to depart immediately, which they were very unwilling to do, but he telling them that he was confident that they would have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice to employ him in, and that he would ere long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and viſit them, they conſented to his departure: but the King was very deſirous for him to take ſome number of knights along with him, which he wholly refuſed: But the Quéen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him a Dwarf which ſhe brought with her from her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court, whoſe ſervice for the Queens ſake he accepted, and ſo he preſently departed on his Iourney, in company of his own Dwarf and that which the Queen gave him, and they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all their Train, retired to the Pallace.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55264:36"/>
that ever drew Sword, and that at ſuch a time when there is the greateſt néed in the world!</p>
               <p>At which words the <hi>Knight of the Golden Image</hi> much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, not knowing how he ſhould be diſcovered in ſo ſtrange a Countrey: But the Lady ſoon ſatisfied him of that doubt, by telling him that ſhe belonged to the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> and was one of thoſe that was with her Miſtreſs releaſed from the power of the Gyant <hi>Altifer</hi> and his Companions, by the ſtrength and power of his invincible arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> much wondring to ſée her, courteouſly asked her in what health her Lady was, and the cauſe of her travel? To this, Sir Knight, replyed ſhe, I ſhall give you an anſwer, on condition that you forthwith go along with me to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there preſent your ſelf to my Miſtriſs and the Princeſs <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risbella,</hi> and there receive ſuch Orders from them as they ſhall give, to which Requeſt he readily conſented; wherefore they ſetting forwards on their Iourney, the Lady began her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as followeth.</p>
               <p>Know then moſt valiant and redoubted Knight, that never ſince the Walls of <hi>Babylon</hi> was built by the brave <hi>Semiramis,</hi> was greater ſorrow within that City than there is now, and never was there greater cauſe of mourning; for it is not a wéek ſince one of the greateſt pieces of Treachery was committed that ever was heard of.</p>
               <p>One day the Souldan, our Dread Lord, accompanied by his Empereſs <hi>Silviana,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taroſa</hi> my Miſtriſs, and many other great Perſonages, having béen a Hunting, were met by a grave old Man and two Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, they were all thrée drawn in a Chariot, and coming near our company, they all made the moſt pitiful complaint in the world: The Souldan taking compaſſion on them, demanded what was the cauſe of their ſo great Complaint: To which ſpéech the old man replyed, that he being travelling to <hi>Babylon</hi> with thoſe two Damſels and his Daughter, two Knights ſéeing his Daughter of admirable beauty, deſired her company to abuſe her, which ſhe not conſenting to, they endeavored to force her, and in the end notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance they could
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55264:36"/>
make, they drew her out of the Charriot, intending to execute their luſts upon her: but ſhe reſolving rather to die than loſe her honor, ſo long reſiſted them, that one of them muſt inhumanely drew his Sword, and gave her ſo great a wound on the head, that ſhe immediately fell as dead to the ground; which they ſeeing, immediately mounted their horſes and departed, leaving my poor daughter ſtretched along the graſs ſtrugling for life: In this manner we all remained, making excéeding lamentations, when an old matron coming by, and being told the occaſion of our complaint, commanded us to bind up the wound, and lay her in the Chariot, telling us that ſhe was not to be cured, but by one ſingle touch of the faireſt hand in the world, now ſir, we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to ſée if we can finde the perſon that ſhall cure this Lady.</p>
               <p>The Souldan and his Daughter having heard this diſcourſe, and ſéeing the Lady lie ſtretched along in the Charriot, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were deſirous to ſée where the wound was given, for which cauſe they both entred the Charriot, at which time the old man whipped his horſes to make them go on, but they ſtirred not one jot; at which he much wondred, and the Princeſs coming to the body of the extended Lady, and touching her wound, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently lifted up her head, and opening her eyes heartily thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Princeſs for her cure, for by her touching the wound ſhe was immediately cured. Much did the old man wonder, that notwithſtanding all he could do to the horſes that drew the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, he could not get them to move one foot, but they ſtood as if their féet had been fixed to the ground: and as much was the Princeſs, and the reſt of the company pleaſed with the finiſhing of that adventure, and therefore the Princeſs ſéeing there was nothing elſe to be done, deſcended from the Charriot, which ſhe had no ſooner done, but the horſes that drew it immediately fell a running in a very violent maner, not giving the Emperor leave to come out; which the Ladies and Knights ſéeing, were greatly abaſhed thereat, and the Empreſs commanded many of the Knights who were beſt mounted, to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Great was the lamentations and ſorrow of the Empreſs, the Princeſs her Daughter, and all the reſt of the ſpectators, not knowing what was become of the Souldan, but they ſtill hoped that ſome of the Knights would overtake the Chariot, but though all the company ſtayed there ſix hours, and all the Knights were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet no news was brought of the Souldan, onely that the Chariot was gone out of their ſight.</p>
               <p>Great was the ſorrow of the Empreſs and her Daughter, and all the reſt of the company, but it growing late they were forced to go back to the City in much dolor; by the way as they went a Damſel came, and méeting the Empreſs gave her a Letter, and immediately departed, which ſhe greatly wondering at, cauſed the ſame to be immediately broken open, wherein was read as followeth.</p>

                  <p>How <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> arrived at the Souldan of <hi>Babylons</hi> Pallace, and how he was received by the Empreſs and Ladies, and of his diſcourſe with the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> and <hi>Mattaroſa.</hi>

               <p>BEfore I tell you how <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was entertained at the Pallace, it will be neceſſary to tell you what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Souldan.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55264:38"/>
reſolved to prevent him, and therefore cauſed that Charriot to be provided, and all the other things which met the Souldan, as is declared in the fore-going chapter, hoping to get her into the Charriot, and then aſſuring himſelf that when he laſhed the horſes, they would run ſo faſt, that he néeded not fear to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: Being thus furniſhed, he arrived néer <hi>Babylon,</hi> as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the fore-going chapter, and having by his piteous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe induced the Souldan and his Daughter to come into the Charriot, he was very joyful, but when he thought himſelf moſt ſure he failed of his enterprize, by means of the King which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> gave her, which had the power over all Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but ſo ſoon as ſhe was deſcended from the Charriot, his Enchantments had their full power, and by that means he carried away the Souldan, as is already declared.</p>
               <p>So long did they travel that at laſt they arrived at a river<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and ſuch power had <hi>Friſtone</hi> with his ſpells, that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan remained all this while in a Trance, whoſe body they took out of the Charriot and placed in a barque which lay there rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſo having embarqued themſelves, they preſently ſet ſayl and ſailed ſo long that they arrived in the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, which they croſſed, and on the north part thereof landed in an Iſland, whither being come, they conveyed the body of the Souldan into a moſt ſtrong Caſtle, and there <hi>Friſtone</hi> put ſo ſtrong a Guard upon him, that he thought it invincible in which place we muſt leave the Souldan to return to his Court at <hi>Babylon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being arrived there, as I have told you, he, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Lady that conducted him, entred into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Empreſs, who was at that time accompanied with her fair Daughter the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Matta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſa,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> her Brother, and many other great perſonages.

them, as the pure light of the Sun, there came ſo many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant beames from them, that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being approached the preſence, and having pulled off his Helmet, was ſo blinded with the pure light that iſſued from them, that he was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dazled: and all her other parts were ſo perfectly rare, that <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelf had ſhe béen there, would have bluſhed to have ſéen her ſelf out-gone in beauty.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs on the other ſide, having never till now ſéen the face of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> was ſo ſurprized with his manly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that ſhe concluded him to be onely Paragon in the world, and that all beauty and valor was worthily in that one perſon concentred.</p>
               <p>The Lady who conducted him thither, ſéeing that he continued ſilent, thus began: May it pleaſe your Excellent Highneſs, to behold an end of my Iourney, for by the help of our Gods here is before you the perſon that ſhall ſo far content you, that you may certainly expect the deliverance of my Lord the Souldan, in ſhort time to be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being very ſenſible of the error he had run into by his ſilence, ſaid to the company: Moſt excellent Princeſſes, what ever my mean labor can accompliſh either in releaſing the Souldan, or in any other Affair, aſſure your ſelves I ſhall be moſt willing to undertake it, &amp; ſhall thank my good fortune if any thing I can do to the utmoſt hazard of my life, ſhall give you any pleaſure; and therefore moſt illuſtrious Empreſs, give me the honor to be commanded by you, and I ſhall run to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof, though it be to my certain death, and ſhall think that part of my life beſt beſtowed, wherein I can in any manner pleaſe or content you.</p>
               <p>The Empreſs having heard and beheld him, replyed: Noble Knight, your preſence at this time is moſt acceptable, and we are ſo far obliged to you for your laſt company, and the hazard that you then underwent for the deliverance of our Daughter, that I cannot with modeſty tell how to deſire you to hazard your perſon any more for us: but ſince the Gods are pleaſed to place all their vertues within your boſom, and ſo to decrée it that none but your ſelf was born to aſsiſt us, I ſhall be thankful
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55264:39"/>
to the Gods for ſo providing a perſon, who may be rightly termed <hi>The deliverer of the Houſe of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  </hi> for without your help we ſhould infallibly periſh, and therefore good Sir Knight, repoſe your ſelf for a few days, and then take ſuch help for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of this adventure as you ſhall think fit, and which the whole Empire will afford, that you may once more reſtore a Husband to me a ſorrowful wife, a Father to an afflicted daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a Prince to his moſt loving ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſaid, ſhe deſcended from her Throne, and came to the place where <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was knéeling, and raiſing him from the ground, he humbly kiſſed her hands, and then went to the place where the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> ſat, not daring as yet to go to the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and humbling himſelf on his knée he kiſſed the hand of the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> ſaying to her: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, when I laſt left you, I gave you my word that I would ere long wait upon you at this place, to obey your commands, and in order thereunto I was coming hither, when the Lady met me, and related to me the misfortune of the Souldan, which hath given me a very ſenſible affliction to ſee that any thing ſhould give a trouble to ſuch divine perſonages as are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: But Madam, aſſure your ſelf, that I will employ all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of my life in finiſhing this adventure, but I will give you the contentment you expect and deſire in the preſence of the Souldan. <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> who was ſenſible of the love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that the Princeſs her Couſin had for the valiant <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and being reſolved to pleaſure her, ſaid: Dear Couſin, you néed not queſtion the performance of this adventure, ſince it is put into the hands of ſuch a Knight, of whoſe worth I am very well ſatisfied, and without whoſe aid I had e're this time béen in my grave; for I would certaintly have given my ſelf a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death, rather then have conſented to the lubidinous deſire of that monſtruous Giant who had me in his poſſeſsion. The Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> now thought it fit for her to ſpeak, and therefore ſhe ſaid, I am ſo well ſatisfied in the worth of this Knight, that I queſtion not the performance of any thing be will undertake, and I have had ſo ſufficient proofs both of his judgement and valor, that I have found the effects to be ſuch,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55264:40"/>
that I am much engaged to him therefore, and I my ſelf had either béen a priſoner or worſe twice ere this but for him; for which two remarkable Services I am ſtill bound to him, and ſhall alway acknowledge my ſelf his debtor, both for the ſervice he did me, and for the precious token he left with me, without which I had now béen in company of my Father, and therefore none hath more cauſe to eſtéem of his vertues then my ſelf: and then turning her ſelf towards him, ſhe ſaid: Aſſure your ſelf, Sir Knight, that I eſtéem my ſelf more bound to you then to all men living, and ſhall always acknowledge it, and next unto my parents I ſhall be always ready to be diſpoſed of by your commands.</p>
               <p>She having thus finiſhed her diſcourſe, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt raviſhed with delight, and humbly kiſsing her fair hand, and fetching a great ſigh, he replyed: Ah dear Madam, all that I have yet done for you, or ſhall be able to perform the remaining part of my life, is already ſufficiently recompenſed by this immenſe favor you have ſo prodigally beſtowed in the humbleſt of your ſervants. He would have procéeded, but that the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> came then to him, and humbly thanking him for the aid he had lent him in releaſing him and his Siſter from the Giant <hi>Altifer,</hi> and ſo he led him from the Ladies, into the company of ſeveral Knights that were there preſent, who much honored him for the worth they underſtood him to be endued withal.</p>
               <p>Thus he ſpent ſome time in this company till it was time to diſarm himſelf, which when he had done, the Princeſs <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taroſa</hi> ſent him a rich Mantle, and by the meſſenger that brought it, ſhe deſired that he would not fail to let her have the happineſs of his company ſome time that evening: To which meſſage he returned anſwer, That he would not fail to wait on her. Moſt of the evening he ſpent in complementing the Knights of the Court, and they in ſhewing him the rarities and novelties thereof, and there he with great wonder and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement beheld the pleaſant Gardens and Fountains there; having ſpent much time in walking, he at length deſired the the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> to ſhew him his lodging, which he did
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55264:40"/>
accordingly, and as he walked thither the Prince told him which was the Souldans, and which was his Siſters, and which was the Princeſs <hi>Florisbellas.</hi> Now the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſas,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Florisbellas</hi> were adjoining together, and his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging was not far from either of them, at which he was very well pleaſed: Having thus ſpent much time he again went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Preſence, where was the Empreſs, her Daughter, and Kinſwoman, and many other Ladies; and thus they ſpent much of that evening in ſeveral diſcourſes, at laſt every one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to their ſeveral appartments. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> remembring the Meſſage he had received from the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his Dwarf <hi>Ordino</hi> to attend her going to her Lodging, and to take notice of ſome one of her Damſels, which the Dwarf performed, and his Maſter being retired into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and alone, he came to him and told him that the Princeſs was now in her Chamber with no other company but two of her Damſels: <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> therefore commanded the Dwarf to go thither and tell one of her Damſels that he deſired to ſpeak with her Lady, and when he ſhould come into her preſence to preſent his ſervice to her, and let her know that he waited her commands. The Dwarf ſoon executed his meſſage, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Maſter, and told him that the Princeſs expected his coming to her Lodging, he therefore immediately left his own Chamber and went to her, where ſhe received him with a great deal of freedom, and cauſing him to ſit down by her, ſhe thus began.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, the great favor you did me in releaſing me from the power of the Giant, is ſo déeply engraven in my breaſt, that all that I can do for you thorough the whole courſe of my life, I ſhall eſtéem too little for a recompence: and if you remember when I then parted from you, I deſired your company here, that it might be in my power to do ſomewhat to gratifie you, if therefore you know any thing wherein I may pleaſure you, ſpeak boldly and fréely, and let me know it, for the time you have to ſtay here being not long, an opportunity of doing you ſervice may ſoon be overſlipt. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having attentively liſtened to this diſcourſe, did much marvel thereat, wondring what the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55264:41"/>
iſſue thereof would be: but while ſuppoſing that his fortune might ſo fall out, that ſhe her ſelf might be in love with him, at which he would have béen much diſcontented; and then an other while ſuppoſing that ſhe might do him ſome great kindneſs in his love to her Couſin, he was therefore reſolved try her minde, and after ſome ſilence he thus began:</p>
               <p>Madam, if I have done you any ſervice, it was no more then I was bound to do by the Order of Knight-hood, beſides it hath béen already ſufficiently recompenſed by this your acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore you reſt no longer indebted to me for that: but there is one thing Madam, wherein you may greatly pleaſure and oblige me of new to be your humble Servant. It is now Madam, ſome years ſince I received the Order of Knighthood, and with it a Sute of Armor which I have ſince loſt, onely I have preſerved the Shield that belonged thereto, not for any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary worth therein, but onely for the ſake of a Picture that is therein pourtrayed, I do believe that you have ſéen it, and may remember that it hath ſome ſmall reſemblance with the Princeſs your Couſin, and indéed for her ſake alone have I kept it, and under the Name of <hi>The Knight of the Golden Image</hi> have I gone ever ſince, and have won many Combates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſo that what ever Act I have done worthy of remembrance may be wholly attributed to her Vertue: this hath cauſed me now twice to come to this Court, not as yet daring to give her any notice of my deſires, now therefore if you are pleaſed to do me any further friendſhip, let it be this, to deſire her to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to admit me to be her Knight, and then I queſtion not but I ſhall be ſufficiently able to perform any Enterprize, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo difficult and perilous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having thus finiſhed his Diſcourſe, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was fully ſatisfied that in doing him a courteſie, ſhe ſhould likewiſe pleaſure her Couſin, whoſe minde ſhe knew very well, but like a diſcréet virtuous Lady, ſhe was reſolved to know what Parentage he was of, and whether that diſ-proportion would not hinder that which they ſo much deſired, and therefore ſhe thus replyed:</p>
               <p>Noble Sir, I give you many thanks for your fréeneſs with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55264:41"/>
me, and aſſure your ſelf that in this matter I ſhall execute your will that you ſhall have your deſires, provided that you engage me in nothing that may be a blemiſh to the Honor of my Fair Couſin, and therefore Sir, I pray tell me who gave you the Honor of Knighthood, that if I be demanded that Queſtion by my Couſin, I may be provided with an Anſwer. To this he ſoon replyed, He who gave me the Order of Knighthood was as then unknown to me, and ſo was I then to him, but ſince I knew him to be the Emperor of <hi>Greece.</hi> Then Sir, quoth the Lady, I queſtion not but he was ſatisfied that by birth you were worthy of it. Ah Madam, ſaid he, he was then told that I was of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Linage by a Lady that was preſent: but ſince he hath known me, and I him better, for indéed he is my Father. Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted he to her the manner of his firſt Adventures, and how he was Knighted by his Father, and how afterwards did fight with him, as it is at large ſet down in the Firſt Part of this excellent Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe ſo well ſatisfied the Princeſs, that ſhe told him that ſince he had béen ſo frée to her, as to tell her his greateſt ſecrets, ſhe would in recompence thereof tell him ſomewhat that ſhould give him equal content, and thereupon ſhe ſaid: Six Knight, I do now aſſure you that you may account your ſelf happy in your love, for the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> my Couſin is altogether as amorous of you as you are of her, and hath been as deſirous to diſcover the ſame, as you your ſelf; and therefore ſo carry your ſelf in this buſineſs, that what ever you do may redound to the honor of you both, and to the end that you may receive the ſame ſatisfaction from her own mouth, I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately go into her Chamber and bring her hither: At which words <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> fell on his knées to the ground, and ſtraitly embracing her legs, he ſaid: Ah dear Madam, what thanks, what ſervices, what returns ſhall I make for this extraordinary favor? But ſhe knowing that a little time would be ſoon loſt, got from him, and leaving him in this Extaſie, went into the Chamber of her Couſin, where ſhe had not ſtayed long but ſhe returned with her Couſin in her company, who now being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, was attired in a Mantle of Crimſon-Velvet, and ſuch
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55264:42"/>
other Garments, that <hi>Juno</hi> in all her Bravery did not appear half ſo ſtately, nor <hi>Venus</hi> when ſhe courted <hi>Adonis</hi> was not half ſo lovely: When they came into the Chamber, they found the Knight on his knees, his extaſie of Ioy had béen ſo great, wherefore the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> taking her Couſin by the hand, led her to him, ſaying: Behold here, Madam, the beſt Knight in the world proſtrate on his knées, expecting from your lips the gracious favor of your admitting him to be your Knight. Ariſe moſt noble Prince, anſwered the Princeſs, for ſo my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin informs me you are, and indéed it could not be expected that ſo great Perfecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ns of Valor, Magnanimity and true Vertue, ſhould abide in the breaſt of any one but the greateſt Prince in the world.</p>
               <p>At theſe words <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> humbly kiſſing her hand aroſe, and then the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> cauſed them both to ſit down: when they were ſate, the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> demanded of him how he performed the Adventure of ſelling her Couſin <hi>Aurora</hi> in poſſeſſion of her Kingdom; for, ſaid ſhe, I hear that ſhe is bound to you for that favor? Then he recounted to her all that happened in that Adventure, how he killed her uſurping Enemy <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> and the many hazards he ran thorough when he went diſguiſed in the Apparel of one of her Damſels, and how at laſt he procured the Souldan of <hi>Perſia</hi> to Confirm her in her Kingdom, and then ſaid he, Madam, I had gone along with her to have ſéen her ſetled therein, but that the remembrance of your divine Beauty, was as attractive to my heart as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to the Néedle, which cauſed me to leave that Charge to two of my Brethren, and ſome other of my Friends, to apply my ſelf hither to wait upon my Commands. And ſaid the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> it, was moſt happy for us both that you went not thither; for I had ere this periſhed without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance you brought me, and the Princeſs my Couſin had ſtill wanted one to undertake the Redemption of her Father.</p>
               <p>Ah moſt noble Lady, replyed he, I ſée now that Fortune and my good Stars have brought me ſome ſwéet with much of bitter I have hitherto run thorough, in that they have given me ſome opportunity of teſtifying to you my ſervice, in which point I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55264:42"/>
wiſh my Deſtinies will ſtill continue me to my lives end, for it will be the greateſt good that can come to me, to ſpend the remainder of my life in the ſervice of ſo Divine Perſonages, and therewith he took the fair Hand of his Miſtriſs, and amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly kiſſed it. In theſe tearms continued theſe Lovers for two or thrée hours, and then they gave to each other ſuch aſſured Teſtimonies of their loves, that it endured for ever.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs ſignified much ſorrow that he was to depart in ſo ſhort time, to hazard his perſon in ſo great perils, but he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, that ſince ſhe thought him worthy of being hers, he did not queſtion but to overcome all difficulties, and in ſhort time return with her Father. Then ſhe deſired him to take ſome company with him, that he might be the better enabled to perform his Enterprize: but he refuſed that, derſiring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it himſelf, that the Souldan her Father might be obliged to none for his Deliverance but to him onely, that thereby he might have the more cauſe to grant him what he ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deſire of him.</p>
               <p>But the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> knowing that her Brother the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> intended to accompany him in this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, perſwaded him that ſince the Iourney was long, and that he was to travel on the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea to ſome uncertain place there, that he would not refuſe his company, which he at laſt aſſented to. Thus having ſpent much of the night in theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, after the two Lovers had given each other new Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Promiſes of an everlaſting Love and Friendſhip, they every one with great ſilence departed to their ſeverall Lodgings.</p>

               <p>THe ſatisfaction the two Lovers received in the Evenings Conference, occaſioned them to take but little reſt that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55264:43"/>
night: never was <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſo contented as now, all his Travels, Combates, Conflicts and bloody Fights, he accounted as nothing, and that they were all more than fully recompenſed by the kinde and loving Diſcourſe he had received that evening from his Princeſs. Theſe thoughts accompanied him all night ſo that he ſlept not at all, but ſtill ruminated in his minde how he ſhould contrive his good fortune, and how he ſhould give ſo good a ſatisfaction to the Souldan, that he might be willing to accept of him for his Son in Law: Theſe thoughts took up all the night, ſo that morning coming, the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> came to his Chamber to give him the <hi>Good morrow,</hi> whereupon he preſently aroſe, and very lovingly received him.</p>
               <p>After he had apparelled himſelf, he left his Chamber, and walked with the Prince in the Garden, where the Prince told him that he had one Boon to beg of him, and therefore prayed that he might not be denyed. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> anſwered, that he might freely ask any thing of him, for he took it as an honor if be could pleaſure him in any thing. Then the <hi>Numidian Prince</hi> told him that the Requeſt he was to make was this, That he would be pleaſed to permit him to have the honor to attend him in his intended Expedition; for, ſaith he, I cannot but acquire much honor and renown in being in the preſence and company of ſo brave and worthy a Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> who had already promiſed his Siſter that he would permit him to go with him, told him, that he could not acquire any fame in his company, but however if he would give himſelf that trouble, he ſhould be glad of his good company. The <hi>Numidian</hi> being very glad that he had granted his Requeſt, gave him many thanks, and told him he ſhould eſtéem his life happy ſo long as he had the enjoyment of his good ſociety, and ſaid he hoped, that having ſo good a Pattern both of Chivalry and Vertue, he did not queſtion but he ſhould profit himſelf very much thereby</p>
               <p>In theſe Diſcourſes they continued ſome time till all the Court was riſen, but it was ſomewhat late before the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes aroſe, they having ſate up ſo late the night before, that it was Noon before they came into the Preſence Chamber, being
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55264:43"/>
come, the Tables were covered, and every one ſate down to Dinner: <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> could eat but little for obſerving the rare Perfections of his Divine Princeſs who was ſeated juſt againſt him, who attired her ſelf in moſt ſumptuous manner, that her Clothes might give ſome luſtre to her Beauty: but although ſhe was habited in an extraordinary manner, yet her face and perſon appeared like the Sun, and they like clouds that obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her other beauties. She often caſt amorous glances at her Knight, and ſéeing his eye ſtill fixed on her, ſhe was often mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bluſh.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Thus did he ſpend two days in the greateſt content and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the world, ſtill accompanied by the Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and by that means he had the opportunity with him of courting the Princeſs his Couſin with the greater fréedom, ſometimes they walked in the pleaſant Walks and Gardens of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and at other times they went abroad in the Fields to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themſelves; in all which time he endeavored by his moſt ordinary actions, to let her ſée the eſtéem he had of her Vertues. The night before he was to depart he took the opportunity to ſpeak to the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> humbly deſiring her that ſince his time was ſo ſhort that he was to depart the next day, ſhe would do him the favor to ſpeak to the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> to give him the happineſs of her Company in her Chamber, that he might take his farewel of her, to which his Requeſt ſhe ſoon conſented.</p>
               <p>So Evening being come, and every one retired to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lodgings, he attended not long before one of the Princeſſes Damſels came to his Chamber, to advertiſe him that the two Princeſſes were together and expected him; He thereupon very joyfully went to the Chamber where they were, and proſtrating himſelf on his knée, he humbly kiſſed her hand, but ſhe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it cauſed him to ariſe, and ſeating her ſelf by him, ſaid unto him:

               <p>Thus did theſe two Lovers diſcourſe with one another, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times embracing each other: and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> knowing that he was to be gone the next day, took more fréedom than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and raviſhed from her lips many amorous Kiſſes, which to him were more pleaſant than <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> or the food of the Gods. Thus ſpent they much time, and would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their amorous diſcourſes longer, but that the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> cauſed them to break off and depart, which they at laſt very unwillingly conſented to: Thus at length they reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their ſeveral Lodgings and went to Bed, taking their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary repoſe.</p>
               <p>The morning being come, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> aroſe early to put all things in order for his departure, but he had not béen long up before the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> and two of his Kinſmen came

to wait on him in his Lodging, but not finding him there they walked into the Garden where they found him, and there the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> told him that he was ready to go with him whenſoever he ſhould appoint him, but told him that he humbly begged him to permit thoſe two Knights to go in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> who was unwilling to deny him any thing he ſhould ask, at length at the intreaty of the two knights them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſented; and thereupon he bid them be ready, for that Afternoon he intended to ſet forward on his Iourney, they reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well ſatisfied, and prepared all things accordingly.</p>
               <p>Thus Noon being come and Dinner ended, he took his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of the Empreſs, the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> and all the reſt of the Court. The Princeſs <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risbella</hi> gave him a new Shield, wherein was her own Picture drawn to the Life, and richly guilded, whereby he went by the Name of the <hi>Knight of the Golden Image.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia</hi> was armed in an Azure Armor, and in his Shield he had a <hi>Boars-head,</hi> he having formerly killed a monſtrous Boar, and therefore he was called <hi>The Knight of the Boar.</hi> The other two Knights were armed in white Armor, they being new Knights: the one, who was amorous of the Princeſs <hi>Matta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſa,</hi> had <hi>Hope</hi> painted in his Shield, and the Princeſs gave him a Scarf as a Favor from her: and the other had a flaming Sword painted on his Shield, becauſe when he was knighted it was with a Sword that reſembled a Flame.</p>

               <p>Long time ſayled they about this Sea, coaſting the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and landing in ſeveral places to enquire after news of the Souldan, but all was in vain. One day a great Calmneſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, they ſayling very ſlowly, deſcried a Ship from afar off ſayling thitherwards, wherefore command was given to the Mariners to bear up to them, which was done with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition they could; when they came néer the Ship they heard the voice of a woman who made great lamentation: At which noiſe <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> wondring, cauſed them to call aboard to them, when preſently two great Gyants armed at all points but their heads, demanded what they required? The <hi>Numidian</hi> anſwered, That they deſired to know the cauſe of the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they heard. The Gyants ſéeming very angry at his demand, replyed, That they might meddle with their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, for that did in no wiſe concern them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> hearing theſe proud ſpéeches, commanded the Ship to go néerer to the other and grapple with her, which was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55264:47"/>
done accordingly, and the Gyants clapping on their Helmets, drew their mighty Symetars to hinder the entrance of the Knights, who by the example of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> were all provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to aſſail the Gyants in their own Ship: but our Knights ſo laid about them, that one of the Gyants was ſoon laid along the Ship. At this noiſe ten well-armed Knights who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, came up, and drawing their Swords went to aſſail our Knights, who defended themſelves very bravely, and <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus this Gyant being diſpatched, he turned him about to help his Companions, but he ſaw they had behaved themſelves ſo well, that they had either killed or vanquiſhed all the Gyants Knights, wherefore he putting up his Sword, commanded the Mariners to conduct him to the place from whence they heard the noiſe, which they did accordingly: and being come thither, ſaw a Damſel who made great lamentation, but he demanding of her the cauſe of her Complaint, ſhe aroſe, and ſéeing him knew him by his Armor, when falling on her knées, ſhe ſaid: Ah moſt courteous Knight! I now know that I am releaſed from the ſlavery and bondage I was going to, having met with you. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> knew not the Damſel, wherefore raiſing her from the ground, he demanded of her how ſhe knew him? To which ſhe replyed, I am confident Sir Knight, that I am not miſtaken in my knowledge of you, for without doubt you muſt néeds be the valiant Prince <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> of whoſe proweſs and vertue I am ſufficiently acquainted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know Sir, that I belong to the ſage <hi>Bellona</hi> your very good Friend, who underſtanding of the Enterprize that you were going about to releaſe the Emperor, and knowing that all the

skill and art that your Mariners could uſe would not be to any purpoſe, for it is impoſſible to finde out the place where he is kept without her help, ſhe therefore ſent me to conduct you thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and commanding me to go towards the Court of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan of <hi>Babylon</hi> to méet you, I being on my way thither, was met by theſe two Gyants and Knights, whom you have happily diſpatched, who ſéeing me alone forced me to go aboard with them, and whither they would have carryed me I am uncertain, but thanks to your valor I am releaſed from that peril.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having heard this Relation, was very glad that he ſhould now be able to finde the place whither he was to go, and therefore thanked the Damſel very kindly for the pains and peril ſhe had undertaken for his ſake: and thereupon he cauſed her to go out of that Ship into his own, where ſhe was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er come, but ſhe eſpying the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince, began to renew her lamentations; at which they all wondring, asked her the cauſe of her ſudden ſorrow? To which ſhe replyed, Ah, Sir Knight, when I came from my Miſtriſs ſhe gave into my cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a Sword, which ſhe commanded me to preſent to her Couſin <hi>Baltaſano,</hi> which ſhe told me he would ere long ſtand in need of, for it had ſo hidden a vertue that it would make its way tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row any Armor, though it were enchanted, and told me that next to the Sword which you had it was the beſt in the world, and theſe two Gyants when they took me, forced the Sword from me, and what they have done with it I know not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince hearing of this was much troubled, fearing leſt it ſhould be loſt or thrown into the Sea with ſome of the dead Knights, wherefore he and the Damſel immediately went into the Ship to ſearch for it: ſo after a little ſearch they found it in one of the Cabins of the Gyants, at which he was very glad; and ſo returning into the Ship of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> they ſhewed it to him, and the Sword was very plain, onely the Hilt was made of entire Emerald.</p>
               <p>This being done, they deſired the Damſel to direct them to the place where the Souldan remained: but ſhe told them that if they would take her directions, they muſt firſt ſayl to the Mouth of the River <hi>Araxis,</hi> and being there ſhe then knew how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55264:48"/>
them. They having heard this, commanded the Mariners to obey her Command, which they forthwith did, and ſet ſayl for the River <hi>Araxis.</hi> In few hours they came thither, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving informed the Damſel thereof, ſhe adviſed with the Maſter of the Veſſel, and told him that he muſt ſayl croſs the Sea di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly northwards, which he accordingly did: thus they leaving the Gyants Ship behinde them, ſayled croſs that great Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being very impatient of their delays, thinking that every day he had bin abſent from his Princeſs to be a year, and therefore he diſcourſed with the Damſel of many matters during the Voyage, that he might paſs away the time the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And ſhe told him that her Miſtreſs had given her no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the particular dangers that he was to undergo in that Adventure, but ſaid that it was the moſt perilous that he ever undertook; for the ſage <hi>Friſtone</hi> who had placed the Souldan there, had uſed his utmoſt skill in his Enchantments, that he might ſtill continue him there a priſoner: but ſhe ſaid that you with the help of the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince, ſhould be able by your great skill and valor, to put an end to all the Enchantments, and deliver the Souldan.</p>

               <p>LOng had they not ſayled before they deſcried Land, and coming néer they found that there were cloſe by ſeveral ſmall Iſlands, in one of which they ſaw a fair Caſtle, wherefore <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſuppoſing that to be the place where the Souldan was, as indéed it was, he cauſed them to make to ſhore: but as they were approaching the ſhore, they ſaw ſeveral Sea-Monſters with much fierceneſs approach the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and made a hideous noiſe: The two young Knights with their Swords in their hands, went down out of the Ship into
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55264:48"/>
the Shallop to get to ſhore, but theſe Monſters ſo laid about them that they ſoon over-turned the Boat, and had not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners immediately thrown out Ropes the two Knights had béen drowned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing this, and that theſe Monſters would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to hinder his landing, and ſéeing that the ſhore was ſo ſhelving, that it was impoſſible for the Ship to come ſo néer it as to land him, taking his Sword in his hand he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Sea, where he was aſſaulted by theſe Monſters who came all about him, but he being well skilled in ſwimming, did ſo bravely behave himſelf that in deſpight of them he got to land, killing one of them with every ſtroke he ſtruck By his Example the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince followed him, but with very great peril of his life, for he was marvellouſly aſſaulted, but at laſt having killed many of them with his ſword, he got to ſhore.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of Hope</hi> ſéeing this, reſolved to do the like, but he failed in his Enterprize; for many of theſe Monſters came about him, and in deſpight of him bit him in many places, and notwithſtanding he ſtruck at them with his ſword, yet it did no more execution upon them than if he had ſtruck upon an Anvile, for his Sword had not the vertue in it to withſtand Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; wherefore by the advice of the Damſel he came back again to the Ship, where he and all the reſt were forced to ſtay, not being able to land.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe two Knights by the help of their pure-cutting Swords got on ſhore, but they were unarmed, wherefore they cauſed them in the Ship to throw their Arms out as far as they could towards the ſhore, where they went and took them up and armed themſelves: But there was no way how they could get their Horſes on ſhore, at which they were much troubled: But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing that the Caſtle was not far off, hoped he ſhould have no great occaſion of them; wherefore commanding them in the Ship to wait their coming thither again, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and marched right on to the Caſtle: When they came néer it, they ſaw that it was marvellous ſtrong, being ſeated on a Rock, and though they walked round about it, they could not finde any way to enter into it. At laſt they eſpyed a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

the entrance into it was like a Well, for it was down-right, and they ſuppoſed it to be a Well, but that there was no water in it: Hereat thinking that that was the way into the Caſtle, they cut down one of the talleſt Trées thereabouts, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> cauſing the <hi>Numidian</hi> to hold the one end of it, was let down into the Cave, but it reached not to the bottom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was forced to take a great leap, and ſo he fell to the ground ſore bruiſed with the fall, and before he could well get up he was aſſaulted by two great and hideous Serpents, who ran upon him and trampled him under their féet, but he ſoon aroſe, and wounded them moſt piteouſly; whereupon they again came upon him, and gave him ſuch laſhes with their monſtrous tayls that it cracked his Armor: but he waiting his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cut off their tayls, ſo that they could not offend him that way, and they making a hideous noiſe, coming on him to be revenged, he cut off both their Heads at one blow. After he had done this, he walked on, and perceiving ſome light went further, and ſaw before him a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The other Dragon was now got upon the back of our Knight, and pulled him down backwards, but he nimbly got from the ground, and being extreamly enraged with the ſmart of his wounds, gave the Dragon ſuch a blow that he cleaved his Head in two.</p>
               <p>When he had done this he ſate down, being ſo faint with the loſs of blood that he could hardly ſtand: after he had taken the air a little he walked about the Court-yard, and there he found a

Baſket and a long Rope tyed to it, wherefore pondering with himſelf what uſe that ſhould be for, he believed that with it he might draw the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince up into the Caſtle, and ſo walking about he ſaw a Pair of Stairs which went up to the Battlements of the outward Wall of the Caſtle, where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come ſaw the Prince walking about the Gréen, prying whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might finde any place to get into the Caſtle: <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> ſéeing this called to him, and told him if that he would come in to him, he would help him up by that Rope and Baſket, to which he readily aſſented, and ſo letting of it down, he drew him up accordingly.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Having ſo done he went to aſſiſt the <hi>Numidian,</hi> but he ſaw that he had likewiſe killed the other Gyant; for being freſh, he laid about him ſo that he had ſlain him without receiving any wound, but one in the arm.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe two friends having finiſhed this Combate, went forwards and entred into a brave Hall paved with Marble, and ſupported with ſeveral Pillars of Iaſper: walking about here they ſaw a Door that led them into a Garden where were many pleaſant Walks, among the reſt one led them to a Vault, at the door of which they ſaw an Inſcription thus written:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They who ſhall have ſo great proweſs as to kill all the Guards, and paſs hither, ſhall yet fail in their expectations, unleſs the Fire that is here preſerved be put out; which being done, this Enchantment ſhall end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Knights having read this, were ſomewhat ſatisfied that they knew what would put an end to this Adventure, and therefore they reſolved to uſe their utmoſt power to accompliſh it: but they knew not how to enter this Cave, the door being very ſtrong, ſearching further they ſaw another door belonging to the ſame Cave, and a Bell hanging thereto, which they rung and then the door opened, and there they ſaw a ſmall Fire in the middle of the Cave: As ſoon as they were entred they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted in marvellous manner, but they could not ſée by whom; they felt many mighty ſtrokes, ſo that ſometimes they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to fall down on their knées, but they could not ſée any body that gave them, and it was in vain to uſe their Swords, for they cut nothing but the Air, at which they both marvelled. And the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince underſtanding by the Inſcription that they had read, that the quenching of that Fire gave an end to the Enchantment, he left <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and went out of the Cave to the Fountain which they had ſéen in the Court-yard, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off his Helmet, intended to fetch ſome water from thence, but when he was come néer the Fountain, and went to dip his

Helmet therein for water, there iſſued out of the water a fierce Crocodile, and flying in his face wounded his head, ſo that he bled excéedingly: at which being amazed, he drew his Sword and had a great Combate with the Crocodile, but in the end the Crocodile remained dead, and he dipped his Helmet into the Fountain and took ſome water from thence and haſted to the Cave, where he found <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſtill in battel with thoſe Fantaſms: he gave many blows, but could not hear any ſound of them, but he himſelf was ſo beaten that he was well nigh out of breath. Thus the <hi>Numidian</hi> arrived in the Cave, and following cloſe to his friend, crying, Courage Sir, procéed to the Fire, for I have gotten that which will put it out: At which words <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> went forwards, and the <hi>Numidian</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

At which they believing the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment to be ended, went towards the Caſtle, where when they came the doors of the Caſtle were opened; and they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Hall ſaw another door which conducted them into another Room, where they met the Souldan walking in great haſte to ſée what was the occaſion of that great noiſe: but when he came down and ſaw the two Knights, he greatly marvelled, not yet thinking the Enchantment to be ended: but they put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their knées to the ground told him, that if as hitherto he had béen a priſoner, he was now by the bounty of Heaven frée; and thereupon the Prince of <hi>Numidian</hi> pulled off his Helmet, which the Souldan ſéeing ran to him, knowing him, and ſaid, Ah good Couſin <hi>Baltaſano,</hi> how much am I indebted to you for this great travel that you have undertaken for my Delivery!

               <p>The Souldan hearing this, went to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from the ground, ſaid: Indéed good Knight, he who

               <p>Arriving at <hi>Trebizond,</hi> and returning this Anſwer to their Maſter, he was at firſt much troubled, but in the end underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the abſence of the Souldan, he reſolved to make uſe of the preſent opportunity to be revenged, as well for the old wrongs his Empire had ſuſtained by the Souldan, as for the new affront ſo lately put upon him, and thereupon he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately commanded that a great Army ſhould be levied, and ſent Commiſſioners into all parts of his Empire to raiſe all the Force he could ſuddenly, intending forthwith to travel towards <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſpoil the Dominions of the Souldan. And this, Sir Knight, is the occaſion of theſe Troops ſo ſudden march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for we are going to the General Rendezvouz at <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bizond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Knight having given this Declaration to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> left him and went forwards, and he ſtayed behinde in a very déep melancholly, conſidering the eſtate of his fair Princeſs: but however he was ſomewhat joyful that he had this occaſion of ſerving her, hoping to do ſuch acts for the defence of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that the Souldan would be thereby induced to beſtow his Daughter upon him. In this conſideration he was, when the Souldan and the reſt of the company overtaking him, asked him what was the occaſion of his leaving them, and what was his large Diſcourſe with the Knight? To which he ſoon replyed, and recounting the whole matter to the Souldan, gave him the greateſt amazement in the world.</p>
               <p>In much trouble did they ride the reſt of the Iourney, being all diſturbed at the late news: but the Souldan was ſomewhat pleaſed in that he was freed himſelf from his late bondage, that he might in perſon be able to reſiſt his enemies, and defend his Countrey, reſolving that he would loſe his whole Empire, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nſet to the Marriage of his Daughter without her own aſſent. This gave <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſome ſatisfaction, in that he knew if the Princeſs had the liberty to diſpoſe of her ſelf, that he ſhould be aſcertained to have her.</p>
               <p>And therefore he deſired the Souldan to trouble his mind as little as he could, for, ſaid he, as I have béen inſtrumental in reſtoring you your liberty, ſo I ſhall not fail to do all that lies in my power to rid you of your enemies, and I have ſo good friends in the world, that if occaſion ſerves I ſhall be able to raiſe ſuch a power, as ſhall eaſily overthrow the deſigns of your enemies to their confuſion, and your own honor. In theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes ſpent they the moſt of their time that they travelled, and the Souldan was forced to diſguiſe himſelf, till he came into his own country, leſt he being known by any of his enemies, ſhould be taken and kept priſoner: but it was not long ere he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in his own dominions, and then he travelled the more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he as yet ſaw no preparations for war, at which he much wondred: but the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> had béen ſo ſudden, that Newes of his Expedition was hardly yet arrived to the Court: when they came within one days journey of the Court, they ſaw ſome preparations for the war, and the Souldan met with many of his Knights, who knowing him were excéeding glad for his deliverance, and that at ſuch at time when as there was moſt néed for him. Thus the néerer he approached the court, the more company he gathered, ſo that by that time he came to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he had above forty thouſand Knights in his company, which gave him much content and joy: but that was not half ſo pleaſant to him, as the fight of his own City, where he was no ſooner entred but the Inhabitants had notice thereof, ſome run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to inform the Empreſs hereof, and others running to méet him, ſtill enquiring which was the Knight that delivered him, and having known him, great was the praiſes they gave him. In this manner they rode thorough the City, and arriving at the Pallace they were met by the Empreſs, her Daughter the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> and many other Ladies, and great Perſonages, and ſo great was the content of the Empreſs and her Daughter, at the return of the Souldan
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55264:53"/>
his company, that they wept excéedingly for joy. The Souldan alighting from his horſe, went firſt and embraced the Empreſs moſt lovingly, and then the Princeſs his Daughter; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him on her knées, but he raiſing her up kindly ſaluted her. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was now on his knées before the Empreſs, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſiring to kiſs her hand, but ſhe knowing how much ſhe was engaged to him would not permit that, but raiſing him from the ground moſt lovingly ſaluted him, giving him many thanks for the great pains he had taken for her, calling him the Reſtorer of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and beſtowed many thanks upon him; when he had received his welcome from the Empreſs, he went to the Princeſs her Daughter, and falling on his knées, humbly kiſſed her hands, but ſhe ſoon raiſed him from the ground reit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terating all the thanks that her Mother had already given him: To which diſcourſe he replyed, and ſaid: That ſince ſhe had béen pleaſed to admit him to the honor of being her Servant, he queſtioned not but he ſhould be able to overcome any Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize how difficult ſoever, and ſince there was an occaſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him of expreſſing his duteous ſervice to her, he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do ſuch acts as might render him worthy of the eſtéem ſhe had of him, or in the proſecution of them, loſs his life as te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the duty he owed her.</p>
               <p>Thus he diſcourſed with her, and then he went to the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> to receive thoſe Welcomes that ſhe had prepared for him, which were in effect the ſame he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before of the Empreſs and her Daughter: and thus taking her by the hand, the Souldan doing the ſame to the Empreſs, and the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince to the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> they walked into the great Hall of the Pallace, where being come the Ladies helped to diſarm them, which when they had done, and had clothed themſelves in rich Mantles, they ſat them down to repoſe themſelves: many of the Nobility came into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to congratulate the return of their Soveraign, and to kiſs his hands, and thank <hi>the Knight of the Golden Image</hi> for the great good he had done them, in reſtoring their Prince to them in ſuch time when they moſt ſtood in néed of his preſence.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> returning them thanks, told them that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55264:54"/>
without the aſſiſtance of the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> he had not béen able to have performed that Enterprize; but however what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer he had he ſhould willingly at all times employ in defence of the Souldan and his country: they were glad to hear theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions from him, doubting that now he had performed this adventure, he would depart; but underſtanding that he was reſolved to ſtay and aſsiſt them in the wars, they humbly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated the Souldan that he would be pleaſed to order <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> to be General of ſuch Forces as ſhould be raiſed to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Trebizond:</hi> To which the Souldan ſoon conſented, but he would not accept of ſo great a charge except the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> might be joyned in Commiſsion with him: To which they all at laſt conſented, and it was ordered as ſoon as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Force ſhould be ready, he ſhould advance towards the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies countries, and the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince ſhould ſtay at the Court to guard the City, and obey ſuch further orders as ſhould be neceſſary. In theſe conſultations they continued moſt of that evening, till it was time for every one to go to reſt: at which time he commanded his Dwarf to give him notice of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Princeſſes to their Lodging, becauſe he was very deſirous to have ſome conference with them; which the Dwarf did ſo effectually, that he brought word that the Princeſſes were both together in the Lodging of the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent him to the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> to know whither he ſhould give them the trouble of a viſit in that place; ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the Princeſs her Couſin therewith, they ſo ordered it, that ſhe diſmiſſed all her Damſels but one who was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her Love, and ſo telling the Dwarf that his Maſter might come when he pleaſed, the Dwarf returned with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Maſter, who being glad thereof departed out of his own Lodging to go into that of the Princeſs, which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did, as ſhall be declared to you in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Knight, ſince I have admitted you to be mine, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that you give me ordinary ſatisfaction of telling me the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of your proceedings in this adventure, and ſince I have not yet heard the particulars thereof, I pray let me have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them from your own mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam, replyed <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> the actions that I have done in this occaſion are ſo inconſiderable, that it is not fit that your ears ſhould be troubled with matters of ſo ſmall moment; but

ſince it is your deſire to give your ſelf ſo much trouble, I ſhall give you a ſmall relation of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then did he begin to tell her all the paſſages of that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beginning from the time that they took ſhipping, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py méeting with the Sage <hi>Bellonas</hi> Damſel, the reſcuing her from the Giants, his deſperate attempt in throwing himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea to get to ſhore, his killing of thoſe Monſters, his deſcending the Cave, fighting with the Serpents and Dragons, and all thoſe other actions which he and the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince performed for the releaſing of the Souldan: At which recital ſhe was ſo ſenſibly afflicted when he related any thing wherein he was in any peril, that the chriſtaline tears ran from her fair eyes down her chéeks in great abundance, which made him leave off his diſcourſe, and ſay to her:</p>
               <p>Madam, the trouble that I thought I ſhould put you to in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting theſe adventures, made me deſire to be excuſed in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing them to you, but if I had thought they would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you ſo ſenſible a diſpleaſure, I ſhould for once have ſo far diſobeyed your commands, as not to have given you an account of theſe paſt actions.</p>
               <p>She hearing that he had done, wiping her fair face, ſaid: Sir Knight, the many difficulties that you have run thorough for my ſake, could not chuſe but make me accompany you in tears, but praiſed be the Gods who have delivered you from theſe dangers, and I hope theſe wars once ended, there will be no further occaſion for you to endanger your perſon. Ah Madam, ſaid he, if my diſcourſe hath given you any ſenſe of ſorrow, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelf I was much more afflicted when I had firſt the relation of your misfortunes about the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> and although I did not queſtion your Loyalty, yet I knew not what you might be compelled unto by a fearful Mother and a Nobility without a head: but I am to render you infinite thanks for your ſo reſolute anſwer to his Ambaſſadors, not queſtioning but ſome conſiderations of me the meaneſt of your ſervants, occaſioned you to return that anſwer.</p>
               <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, I never had any inclination for that Prince, for his perſon does not pleaſe me, &amp; beſides that there is ſuch an
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55264:55"/>
antipithy in my nature to any one of the family of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> though never ſo well accompliſhed, that I ſhould have refuſed him; but were there preſented to me the moſt accompliſhed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for vertues and magnanimity, and were be likewiſe ſole Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate of the whole earth ſet in competition to you, Sir, and were you but a bare Knight-errant, my choice ſhould quickly teſtifie that the love I have promiſed to you, is not counterfeit but abſolutely real. He hearing her in theſe tearms fell down on his knées, and ſtrictly embracing hers, cryed out, Ah Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, how do you undo your creature with heaping ſo much bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon him, which in all his life, though ſpent in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, can never merit? The Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> ſéeing them in theſe tearms commanded him to ariſe, and leave off theſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent proteſtations: for, ſaith ſhe, I am confident you are both ſo well ſatisfied of each other affections, that theſe words are impertinent, and muſt néeds give you both ſome ſenſible trouble. They very well knowing that ſhe ſpake a great deal of reaſon, fell from this diſcourſe to ſome other, as what order he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take in his Expedition: To which he replyed, That he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the next day to be upon the march with thoſe Forces that were already raiſed, and go and méet the enemy, if poſſible, in his own quarters, and ſo hinder him from hurting the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: To which the Princeſs was ſomewhat unwilling to give him leave to depart ſo ſoon, but he telling her that the ſooner he went, it was moſt probable he ſhould return the ſooner, and that during his abſence, he would ſend his truſty Dwarf with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> to be delivered to her, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pretence Anſwers might be ſent without any ſuſpition: Theſe things being concluded of, and he taking his hearty fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel both of her and her couſin, after many amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next day he was up early in the morning, and the two Knights <hi>of Hope,</hi> and <hi>the Flaming Sword,</hi> deſired that they might be admitted to wait on him in this Expedition: to which requeſt he being ſufficiently ſatisfied of their valor, aſſented, and gave them both ſufficient Commands under him, which

when he had done, he ſent for the Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and they after ſome Conference together, reſolved immediately to muſter all the Forces that was then in the City; which they having done, found that there was eighty thouſand men. And <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> reſolving to be gone, divided the Forces into two parts, and took under his Command fifty thouſand men, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Forces of his Companion would increaſe dayly: and therefore commanding them all to be in readineſs that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, he repaired to the Souldan and deſired his leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, telling him that old Maxim in War,

               <p>Thus having ordered his Battalions, he commanded the Heads of every Troop to come to the Front of the Army, where he encouraged them by this following diſcourſe: Gentlemen, and fellow Souldiers, the cauſe of this war I ſhall not néed to inform you of, you being already ſatisfied in that particular, the courages of your enemies you likewiſe are acquainted with, having by often experience found that never any of your nation was overcome by them, but that you ſtill marched away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, giving laws to them rather then obeying any of their commands.</p>
               <p>Their preſumption that your King was abſent, was the chief occaſion of this boldneſs in them, or elſe they would not have béen ſo hardy as to enter your Land, and now being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after all this proviſion to turn back again without abiding the hazard of a Battel, they with much unwillingneſs expect you;

their intention was to force your Princeſs, command your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, diſpoſe of your perſons, and to make all the Inhabitants of this kingdom their Vaſſals, hoping to have found you in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and without a Head, but thanks be to heaven you have not onely a Head to rule over you, in that your gracious Soveraign is reſtored, but alſo a General who will hazard his perſon to the utmoſt with you, and therefore I queſtion not but you will have hearts to follow my example, and if you ſée any thing of courage in me to imitate me therein and follow my example, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelves that I reſolve to conquer or die: thus hoping you have all the ſame courage and reſolution, let us bravely fall on our enemies.</p>
               <p>This ſpéech being ended, cauſed a great ſhout throughout the whole Army, and preſently every one repairing to his own command, they marched on to aſſault their enemies; who all this while were not idle, but the Emperor not forgetting what was neceſſary to be done, did likewiſe order his Battel, and divided them into four parts, one of fifty thouſand men he commanded himſelf, the Prince of <hi>Albania</hi> commanded the like number, and two mighty Giants of his kindred, commanded the other two Squadrons.</p>
               <p>Thus having divided his Forces, and ordered his Battel, he was likewiſe about to make an Oration to his Souldiers, but the noiſe which his enemies made in their approaches diverted him, and therefore cauſing his Trumpets and Drums, and all maner of millitary Inſtruments to ſound, he being armed at all points in the Front of the Army, went forwards to receive the <hi>Babylonians.

incredible fury: Long did their Combate endure together, ſo that both Armies joyned, and as well the Soldiers as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders performed wonders, making an incredible ſlaughter: at length one of the Gyants, Couſin to the Emperor, advancing with his Troop, arrived at the place where the two Generals were in Combate, and reſolving to diſpatch <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly came behinde him, and gave him ſo weighty a blow on the Helmet, that he fell backwards on his horſe, and he going to redouble the ſame had certainly killed him at the ſecond blow, had not the horſe of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> run away with his Maſter, who ſoon coming again to himſelf, and being extraordinarily enraged, perceived that it was the Gyant that had uſed him ſo hardly, for he ſtill purſued him to take away his life; which he ſéeing, being more enraged than any <hi>Numidian</hi> Lioneſs berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of her whelps, the fire ſparkling from his eyes, let fall his Target, and taking his Sword in both hands, laid ſo puiſſant a blow on the Gyant, that he did cleave him down from the head to the middle. The <hi>Black Knight</hi> ſéeing this, cryed out, Oh ye Gods! with how much force and valor have you endued one ſingle Knight?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having done this execution, ſpurred on his beaſt, and more furiouſly than a baited Bull entred the Army of his Enemy, where he did kill and ſlay all that came within the reach of his Sword. The <hi>Black Knight</hi> did the like, till at length he was encountred with by the <hi>Knight of Hope,</hi> who in deſpight of his reſolution to go forwards, made him ſtay and bravely received him: but the <hi>Black Knight</hi> being of admirable force and dexterity, ſo handled him that in ſhort time he left him without ſenſe or motion, and ſo he departed and went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, killing and ſlaying all that had the valor to oppoſe him. Thus continued he a long time, till one came to him, and told him that his preſence would be very neceſſary in his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for that the <hi>Knight of the Golden Image,</hi> and thoſe who followed him, had put one of the Squadrons of his Army to the rout, which he hearing preſently departed: and coming to the place where <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was, he ſaw him perform things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, for he was in purſuit of many Knights, none of them
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55264:59"/>
having ſo much reſolution as to turn their faces towards him, for if they did they certainly met with their deaths.</p>
               <p>The Emperor ſéeing this, was forced for the ſafety of his own men, to engage himſelf once more in Combat with him, which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was not at all diſcontented at, but renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his forces, he likewiſe renewed the Fight with him. Theſe two valiant Champions continued long in fight together, and gave to each other ſuch violent blows, that thoſe Forces that were there ſtood ſtill and forbore fighting, to behold them: But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> whoſe match was not to be found throughout the whole Vniverſe, being angred that the Fight continued ſo long, gave the Emperor ſo mighty a blow on the arm that he wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo mightily, that his Sword fell out of his hand; which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing, and intending to redouble his blow, was prevented: for many valiant Knights who had till then ſtood ſtill, ſéeing their Prince in ſo great danger, went and ſuccored him, and in deſpight of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> carried him away to his Tent, where when his wound was dreſſed, be would have entred the Fight again, but his Chirurgeons would not in any wiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
               <p>Thus the abſence of the Emperor cauſed <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his party to prevail: but although he behaved himſelf with great valor, and killed many Knights and Giants, yet their great numbers ſtill freſhly coming on, in the end tired him, ſo that when the night approached (he having continued the Battel all that day) he withdrew his men, and contented himſelf with what he had done; for the next morning having taken an account of the numbers that he had loſt, be found that he wanted but Fiftéen thouſandſmen, when on the enemies part were ſlain at leaſt fifty thouſand men.</p>
               <p>That day <hi>the Knights of Hope,</hi> and of <hi>the Flaming Sword</hi> did perform bravely, and not having ever béen in any Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they by the example of their General performed excellently both in commanding and executing, and the Prince of <hi>Meſapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia</hi> though a moſt valiant Knight, and much againſt his will, this day performed nothing, for he remained where his General had commanded him, and there was no occaſion to uſe that force
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55264:59"/>
that was under his Command till it was night, and then they retreated in good order to the place were he was placed, and there taking up their quarters expected the approach of the next mornings ſun to renew their fight. News was ſoon carried every where of the good fortune of the Knight of <hi>the Golden Image,</hi> and the Forces under his command, and how that in ſingle Combate he had ſo wounded the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> in the arm, that he was forced to leave the fight, and of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantages that he had gotten, which cauſed many more of the Souldan of <hi>Babylons</hi> Subjects to come in unto him, and the next day there arrived a freſh ſupply of fifty thouſand men from the Prince of <hi>Numidia;</hi> with promiſe and aſſurance that he himſelf would within few days be with him in the Head of one hundred thouſand men, and then they did not queſtion but they ſhould be able to expel their enemies out of the Country.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> believing that he had Forces enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to perform that without any new Additions, reſolved to try the fortune of another day with his whole Army, reſolving to die or drive his enemies out of the field. In this reſolution be continued, and therefore gave order that all ſhould be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to fall upon their enemies, whenſoever he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> was much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at the wound he had received, but he reſolved that ſhould not hinder him from fighting in his own perſon in the next Battel which he intended ſhould be within two days, for by that time he expected a recruit of fifty thouſand men which were already raiſed, and onely ſtaid behind to expect his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for them to advance: which Forces he ſent for with this reſolution, that as ſoon as they were come to him he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain hazard another Field-battel, but he was hindered of his purpoſe, for <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> according to his reſolution he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken, did engage him and all his Forces in another Field-battel, before the arrival of his other Forces, as ſhall be ſhewed you at large in the Chapter following:</p>

               <p>TWo hours before day the next morning did <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis,</hi> without any noiſe of Trumpets, or other War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Inſtruments, leave his own Camp, and with his whole Forces marched to aſſault his Enemies, who having kept a ſtrict Watch took the Alarm, but before they could put themſelves in a readineſs, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Forces had ſacrificed the lives of above twenty thouſand men.</p>
               <p>The Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> being enraged at this ſurpriſal, ſoon called for his Armor, and having armed himſelf therewith, and being mounted on a luſty Courſer, ſoon revenged himſelf of ſome of his Enemies, for before be brake his Lance he diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above twenty Knights, and being accompanied with twenty fierce Gyants (who were appointed for his Guard by reaſon of the laſt days misfortune) they with their broad and ſharp cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Cymetars and Battel-axes made a woful deſtruction, to what place ſoever they came preſent death followed to thoſe that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55264:60"/>
reſiſted them: at length they met with the Prince of <hi>Meſapota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> who having béen idle all the laſt Battel, was reſolved to make amends in this days Combate, and went with a Guard of one hundred Knights, killing and forcing their ways tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the enemies Camp: Him and his Knights did the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his Giants aſſail, and betwéen them happened a bloody Conflict; for the Giants being of the beſt in the whole Army, had preſently ſlain twenty of his Knights, which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the <hi>Meſapotamian,</hi> that maugre all their reſiſtance, he ſent two of their black ſouls immediately to accompany his Knights, and fiercely breaking thorough the midſt of them, he ran againſt the Emperor with great advantage, for he well nigh diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him from his horſe: for he not being provided for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, was forced to catch hold of his horſe neck to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from falling. At which aſſault he recovering himſelf, and being enraged, with his Sword gave his adverſary ſo mighty a blow on the helmet, that he bent his head to the horſes neck, and would have ſoon diſpatched him of his life, but that the <hi>Knight of Hope</hi> came then timely enough to prevent him, and ſo received the blow, and returned it ſo fiercely on the Emperor that he was wounded on the Thigh: and by this time the Prince of <hi>Meſapotamia</hi> was recovered to his ſenſes, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger he was delivered from, was firſt thankful to the heavens, and then revenged himſelf on one of the Giants, who was next him, whoſe Arm he cut off, and wounded him ſo in the ſide, that his life was ſacrificed to his revenge.</p>
               <p>Thus the Battel was in this part of the field, but the <hi>Knight of the Golden Image,</hi> and the <hi>Knight of the Flaming Sword</hi> kéeping company with one another, made very great havock of their enemies, and being followed by a great party of valiant Knights, gave the enemy ſo terrible an On-ſet, that after two hours contention they fled and left the field, having firſt left it thickly ſtrewed with the dead bodies of the Emperors Forces. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> purſued him ſo long, that in the end they came to a great River, and ſéeing that death was both before and behind them, they made a ſtand and bravely reſiſted him and all his Forces, where they fought ſo deſperately, that the ſtreames of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55264:61"/>
the River, which were went to be of a chriſtaline hew, were now by means of the great ſlaughter was there made, become of a ſcalret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All this while the Emperor and his Giants, with great part of his Forces, were engaged, as I told you, with the Prince of <hi>Meſapotamia</hi> and the <hi>Knight of Hope,</hi> where though they on both ſides performed miracles, yet in the end be in deſpight of all the reſiſtance he could make, after the death of many of his Giants, and a very great ſlaughter of his men, was likewiſe forced to retreat, which he did with a great deal of ſobriety, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that the other part of his Army was in better caſe then that which he commanded. But he was not long without the knowledge of what had happened to them: and hearing that they were engaged at the River ſide, he then commanded ſome of the moſt valiant of the Grants to make good the Retreat with the beſt advantage, and the leaſt loſs that they could, while he himſelf went in all haſte to his Forces, hoping by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to put new courage into their breaſts. When he came to them, he found that they had made a mighty reſiſtance, and that ſhe Fight was very bloody; wherefore that he might exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the part of a diſcréet General, and bring them off with the leaſt loſs, he knowing that there was a Bridge not far off, ſent to poſſeſs it: which when he had done, he commanded his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to retire thither as faſt as they could, he himſelf, with the moſt valiant Knights of his whole Army, making good the Rear as well as they could; but notwithſtanding all the diligence and valor that they could uſe, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and the Knights with him plyed their buſineſs ſo well, that ere they got over the River many of them loſt their lives: At length they got to the other ſide of the River, and in deſpight of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and all his Forces, they cut down the Bridge, ſo that there was no way for him and his Forces to follow them.</p>
               <p>This being done, he left a ſtrong Guard at the Rivers ſide, and then returned to the place where the Emperor had encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, where they found great Treaſure; for ſo great was their haſte in their Retreat, that they had not time to take any thing with them. All the Booty of the Emperors Camp he gave to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55264:61"/>
the Souldiers, which gave them a great ſatisfaction, and cauſed them ever to have a great eſtéem of him.</p>
               <p>This being done, he diſpatched meſſengers to inform the Souldan, of what he had done not forgetting to write to his Dear Princeſs, the remembrance of whom made him the more deſirous to put an end to theſe wars, that he might ſolace his ſpirits in her company. The Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> being thus forced to leave the field, and ſéeing that fortune was a little contrary to him, yet being of an extraordinary courage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſtill to perſevere in his enterpriſe, and not to leave off baſely, hoping in the end to attain his deſires, and in order to the ſtrengthning and recruiting his Forces, he ſent commands to thoſe Forces that were behind, to a wait his coming to a City called <hi>Pharez,</hi> which was the firſt City in his Empire; which being accordingly done, one evening leaving ſome horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at the River ſide, he raiſed his Camp and departed to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> and the next day thoſe that he had left behind at the water followed him: He thus being arrived at the City, fortified it both within and without, and ſent thoroughout his Empire to all places for help, reſolving to make that place the ſeat of war, for elſe he knew that the Souldans Forces would follow him further.</p>
               <p>The next day after their departure, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thereof by thoſe he had left at the water ſide, wherefore he marched down thither, but do what he could it was two days before he could mend the Bridge, which the Emperor of <hi>Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zond</hi> had cauſed to be broken; which when he had done, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over with his whole Army, reſolving to purſue his enemy, which he did accordingly: and thus in good order he marched till he arrived néer the City of <hi>Pharez,</hi> where he ſaw that the enemy had made ſtrong entrenchments without the Town, ſo that all he did at preſent was to encamp himſelf néer them; which when he had done, he prepared to give them an aſſault, which he did, as ſhall be ſhewed you in the Chapter following.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>DOn Bellianis</hi> being extreamly deſirous to do all that might be poſſible for the overcoming of his enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other help came to him, that he might acquire the more honor thereby, reſolved to ſet upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Camp that was without the City, and (if poſſible) force them to retire into the City, that he might lay a cloſe Siege thereto, and ſo hinder them from going abroad for proviſions. In order to which reſolution, after his men had reſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he commanded them to provide to aſſault their enemies.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide the Emperor reſolving to abide him there, took care for freſh ſupplies, for he not onely ſent thorough all his own Dominions for more help but likewiſe ſent Ambaſſadors to thoſe Kings that were either his Friends or of his Alliance, ſuch as were the Kings of <hi>Albania, Georgia,</hi> and the Emperor
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55264:62"/>
of <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> deſiring them not to fail him in this occaſion, and the Ambaſſadors who went made ſuch expedition, and had ſuch good ſucceſs in their Embaſſies, that the Emperor had great aſſiſtance, as you ſhall hear hereafter. In the mean time, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had not onely a valiant, but a politick enemy to deal with, he kept ſtrict Guards both within and without the City, leſt he ſhould be ſurprized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> notwithſtanding all the diligence he took, did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize him; for having drawn out a Squadron of fifty thouſand Knights, the moſt accompliſhed in the whole Army, cauſed them to put a piece of white ſilk, or cloth in their Helmets, that they might know one another though in the dark: and in the middle of the night, when his enemies expected no ſuch matter, he came to the Camp, and killing the Centinels, fell in among the Emperors Forces, and ſlew many of them before they could arm themſelves, and ſuch was their confuſion in the dark, that they without knowledge ſlew one another, not knowing their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from friends by reaſon of the darkneſs of the night, and their not being acquainted with his ſtratagem. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he run thorough the Camp, and being followed by the beſt of his Army, came to the walls of the City, deſiring them to open, perſwading the Guards that they were of their own party, telling them that they muſt néeds ſpeak with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: but the Guards who had commands to the contrary, went immediately to the Emperor and told him thereof, who ariſing from his bed, came to the wall, and then he very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the Army was alarmed; wherefore he refuſed to open the Gates, not knowing whither they were of his own Army or Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> perceiving this, and that it would be to little purpoſe to continue there, departed, and ſo returned thorough the enemies Camp, killing and ſtaying all that were in his way, and ſo being gone thorough the Camp and paſſed all the Guards, he cauſed the retreat to be ſounded; which his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hearing, ſoon underſtood the meaning thereof, and ſo left the Camp and came to him; who when they were c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55264:63"/>
an intent to ſurprize the City, and fayling therein, as you have heard, was ſomewhat vexed: but however he conſidered that he done them a ſufficient miſchief, for he had killed above twenty thouſand of his enemies, and came off with the loſs of not above five hundred men.</p>
               <p>This action gave the Emperor a ſenſible diſpleaſure, and did reſolve if poſſible to revenge it, but he could not at preſent put his reſolves into execution, wherefore he gave ſtrict commands to kéep double Guards, and more ſtrict Watches, hoping in ſhort time to have ſuch aid that he might be able not onely to revenge that loſs, but to beat his Foes out of the field: But before any Forces came to his aſſiſtance, <hi>Baltaſano</hi> Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> arrived at the Camp of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> with one hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thouſand men, and with new Orders from the Souldan, that if the Emperor would pay the coſt of the War, and disband his Forces, that then he ſhould have peace, otherwiſe that they ſhould proſecute the War againſt him to the utmoſt; ſuch was the deſire and inclination that the Souldan had for peace.</p>
               <p>Theſe Orders much troubled <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> being very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented that the War muſt end, and that he could not ſacrifice the life of his rival, fearing him ſo long as he ſhould live, leſt he ſhould ſo propound the having of the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> as the Souldan ſhould accept of it, and indéed when the prepoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſent to the Emperor, he was willing to accept of them provided be might have the Princeſs for his Wife, otherwiſe he would ſtand to the utmoſt hazard of the war, not queſtioning but by the help of his Allies and Friends, but that he ſhould not onely be able to beat his enemies out of his Country, but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault them in theirs, and give them ſuch trouble that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan would be willing to propound his Daughter for a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the War.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer being returned to the two Generals <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> and <hi>Baltaſano,</hi> diſpleaſed them both, but the anger that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was in at this propoſition was ſo great that I am not able to expreſs it; for riſing from the place where he ſat, he delivered this anſwer to the meſſenger:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Go tell thy Maſter, that ſo long as the Souldan of <hi>Babylon</hi> has

Subjects in his whole Empire, that he ſhall never compel him to ſuch baſeneſs as the proſtituting his moſt Royal Daughter to one ſo baſe and unworthy: and were all the treaſure of the Souldan exhauſted, all his Subjects ſlain, and none left in his whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to defend him, yet I would command ſuch an Army from other parts in defence of the Royal Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> as ſhould not onely be able to expel thy Maſter from the Souldans Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but alſo to deſtroy him, and all his in the very heart of his own Kingdom. And tell thy Maſter, that ſince he hath neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the gracious and favorable Propoſitions of the Souldan, that he now expect no more, but prepare himſelf for all the misfortunes that a cruel and bloody War can bring him: And tell him, that I the <hi>Knight of the Golden Image,</hi> do reſolve when next I meet him to bereave him of his life or loſe my own in the attempt, and hereupon I bid him mortal battel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the anſwer of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and it was ſpoken with ſo much fierceneſs, that the very fire iſſued from his eyes for anger, and he could hardly utter his words for the inward vexation that he took at the demands of the Emperor. Thus the meſſenger being returned, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and <hi>Baltaſano</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved both to aſſault him on the next day, and uſe their utmoſt endeavors to gain the City, and thereupon they provided all things ready for an aſſault.</p>

The day being come, and all things provided, the Quéen and <hi>Don Brianel</hi> were married in great pomp, and ſhe that day was moſt richly attired, ſo that notwithſtanding all her ſorrow in her travels, ſhe appeared to be one of the moſt handſome Princeſſes in the world: Dinner being ended, every one reſorted to the Tilt-yard, which was néer the Pallace, where a Scaffold was erected, and on that was placed two Chairs of State for the King and Quéen to ſit and behold the Tournaments and Feats of Chivalry that was to be performed.</p>

                  <hi>Don Clarineo, Don Lucidamore, Don Contumeliano,</hi> and <hi>Flioriſpiano,</hi> and a young Knight called <hi>Trion,</hi> or <hi>the Knight of the Wolf,</hi> who was Son to <hi>Damartino</hi> the late Governor, were the Challengers, who undertook to Iouſt, and kéep the Field againſt all corners for ſix days, and accordingly they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed at all points, entred the Liſts, and commanded the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55264:64"/>
Trumpets to ſound, and the Herald to proclaim, that if there were any adventurous Knights that would in honor of the King and Quéen break a Lance, they were there ready to receive him; which was no ſooner done, but there came a Knight armed in white Armor, who taking a Lance entered the Liſts, and expected the ſound of the Trumpet that he might begin his Courſe: the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> did the like, and they bravely méeting brake their Lances in the encounter, and ſo paſſed on; at the next encounter the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> had ſo good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as to overthrow the other Knight out of his Saddle, and paſſed on being unſhaken, and expected another Aſſaylant, when preſently another Knight armed in azure Armor, entred the Liſt, and doing his obeyſance to the King and Quéen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the encounter, which was ſo fierce that he loſt both his ſtirrops, and the horſe of the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> was on his buttocks, but he ſoon made him riſe and ſo went bravely on, when taking another Lance, and reſolving to be revenged of his late diſgrace, he ran ſo fiercely againſt the Knight in the azure Armor, that he ſent him from his horſe to the ground with his Saddle betwéen his legs.</p>
               <p>After this, another Knight entred the Liſt armed in a gréen Armor, and on his Shield was painted a Knight leaning on the ground under a tuft of trées, and he went by the name of <hi>the Solitary Knight:</hi> This Knight after his due reverence to the King and Quéen, pranced about the field with a great grace, at laſt he arrived at the end of the Liſts, and taking a Lance from one of his pages, at the ſound of the Trumpets began his Careſs, and performed ſo well that he made the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> loſe both his ſtirrops, he being very little ſhaken with the encounter: At the ſecond courſe the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> in revenge of the former blow, ran ſo fiercely that he threw <hi>the Solitary Knight</hi> horſe and man both to the earth: at which there was a great ſhout.</p>
               <p>And thus did the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> throw many Knights from their horſes, ſo that he that day diſmounted ſixtéen, and the night coming on they left off that ſport, and retiring into the Court, they diſarming themſelves, fell to dancing: In
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55264:65"/>
which exerciſe they were as perfect as the other, ſo that they are as fit for <hi>Venus</hi> as <hi>Mars.</hi> Much of the evening they ſpent in theſe kinde of exerciſes, but at length they left off, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the King and Queen to Bed, where the fair Princeſs gave to <hi>Don Brianel</hi> as full and frée poſſeſſion of her Body, as he had formerly given her of her Kingdom, and there be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a full ſatisfaction for all the travels he had ſuſtained in her ſervice.</p>
               <p>Much was the content they both received, and I ſuppoſe there was but few Knights in the Court but did envy their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and would have béen glad to have had the company of ſo ſwéet a Bed-fellow as he enjo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They being all dreſſed, noon was come when they ſat down to Dinner, which being done they all went to the Tilt-yard to proſecute that Sport they had begun, where every one being ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſame order they were the day before, the five Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions rid about the Field expecting the arrival of ſome adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Knight: they had not ſtayed long ere they had their deſire, for there entred a Knight into the Field armed in black Armor, cauſing his Horſe bravely to praunce about the Field, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Duty to the King and Quéen, and then taking a Launce expected the ſound of the Trumpet, which being heard he put forwards, but he was encountred with ſuch force by the <hi>Knight of the Wolf,</hi> that he was thrown from his horſe, and forced to meaſure his length on the earth; which having done he retired, and then there entred into the Liſts a Knight armed with a white Armor, as a New Knight, and on his Shield he had two Keyes of Gold painted very artificially: this Knight gave all the Spectators cauſe of admiration, for he demeaned himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courteouſly, not onely in his ſaluting the King and Quéen, but in his reſpects to all the Spectators, and taking a Launce in his hand he ran againſt the <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> ſo furiouſly, that at the firſt encounter he threw him to the earth, to the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55264:65"/>
great amazement of the Company, who now took him for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brave Knight. Having performed ſo well with the <hi>Knight of the Wolf,</hi> he faced about and expected to méet with ſome other Knight, and be failed not long in his expectation, for <hi>Flioriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piano</hi> of <hi>Swevia</hi> taking a ſtrong and knotty Launce, at the ſound of the Trumpets met him with ſo great fury, thinking to revenge his Companions quarrel, but he was deceived therein; for he onely brake his Launce upon his Enemies Shield with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing him any other harm, and the <hi>Knight of the Keye,</hi> having likewiſe broke his Launce, took another and ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a new Caréer: but that ſecond was more to the diſ-advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>Flioriſpiano</hi> than the former, for he loſt both his Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops, and was forced to catch hold of his horſe neck to kéep him from falling; at which he was much enraged, ſéeing his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſtill on horſe-back, and having onely loſt one of his Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops; but before he came to the end of the Liſts he bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf, and ſo they did both, and taking new Launces ran again, but to the greater misfortune of <hi>Flioriſpiano</hi> than before, for he was now tumbled from his horſe. This gave much wonder to all preſent to think who the <hi>Knight of the Keyes</hi> was, for he was wholly unknown there, and came then by chance, as ſhall be told you hereafter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Keyes</hi> having performed ſo valiantly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected another Knight to encounter him, when preſently <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliano</hi> Prince of <hi>Phenieia</hi> prepared himſelf for the Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and taking a Launce in his hand went forwards to the <hi>Knight of the Keyes,</hi> and ſaid to him: Sir Knight, I have one requeſt to make to you before we try our fortunes with the Lance, which is, that you would tell me your Name, and of what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey you are.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>the Knight of the Keyes</hi> courteouſly replyed, Sir Knight, I am known by no other Name than <hi>the Knight of the Keyes,</hi> and to tell you any other Name would little ſatisfie you, for I was born in a Countrey ſo far from hence, that it hath ſeldom here béen heard of; and Ile aſſure you I came hither by accident, and never was in your company, nor in this place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till this day, and therefore if you have nothing elſe to ſay to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55264:66"/>
me, let us procéed with our Lances. To which the Prince of <hi>Phenicia</hi> replyed, I to my experience know, Sir Knight, that you do perform very well with the Lance, therefore I pray grant this Requeſt, that if we chance both to break one or two Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without any effect, and neither of us have any advantage, that you will procéed to the Sword, where we may have more occaſion to try our valors. To this Requeſt <hi>the Knight of the Keyes</hi> conſented, and ſo they forthwith brake off their diſcourſe, and began their Caréer.</p>
               <p>Great was the fury with which both theſe Champions met, and they reſolving to ſhew all their ſtrength, brake their Lances in pieces, and ſo paſſed on: at the next encounter they reſolved to perform better, and ſo they did, for they not onely brake their Lances, as before, but méeting with their bodies with great fury, fell both to the ground. Great was the admiration at this wonderful encounter, and both the Knights were themſelves much amazed, but they nimbly got on their féet, and <hi>the Knight of the Keyes</hi> being angred at this misfortune, went to the Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> and ſaid: Sir Knight, it was your deſire before we tryed our fortunes with the Lance, that if we ſhould have no advantage with the Lance, that we might end the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with the Sword: now ſince we have both had an equal misfortune, and thereby are uncapable to end the difference with the Lance, let us finiſh it with our Swords: To which the Prince of <hi>Phenicia</hi> conſented. And ſo they drew their Swords and began a marvellous brave Combate, to the ſatisfaction and admiration of all the Beholders: they being equally reſolved to make amends with their Swords for the default of their Lances, laid on many luſty ſtrokes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Keyes</hi> being a young and luſty Knight, behaved himſelf very nimbly, giving his Adverſary very many ſtrokes, and ſtill avoiding thoſe of his Enemy, which ſo enraged the Prince of <hi>Phenicia</hi> that he ſhould be ſo uſed before ſo many brave Knights his Friends and Companions, that be reſolved to faſten one blow on his Enemy that ſhould end the Combate, but he was deceived; for though it was ſo mighty a ſtroke that <hi>the Knight of the Keyes</hi> was forced to lay one hand on the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55264:66"/>
ground to ſave himſelf from falling, yet he quickly recovered himſelf, and gave his Adverſary a mighty blow on the Thigh, ſo that he was wounded there extreamly: Which the King and Quéen ſéeing, and doubting that what was begun in Ieſt and for Recreation, would end in earneſt, and in the execution of one or both of their lives, cauſed them to be parted; much pitying that two ſuch brave and valiant Knights ſhould ſo injure one another upon ſo ſlender an occaſion. They being parted, the Sport for that day ended, and every one returned to the Pallace, much wondring who <hi>the Knight of the Keyes</hi> ſhould be.</p>

               </argument>
               <figure/>
               <p>IN the weſt Part of Chriſtendom there is an Iſland called <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which Iſland <hi>the Knight of the Keyes</hi> was born, in a City called <hi>Wexford,</hi> ſcituated néer the Sea-ſide: his Parents being Chriſtians at the time of his Baptizing gave him the Name of <hi>Peter.</hi> His Father was Earl of one of the Provinces of that Iſland, called <hi>Munſter,</hi> and Brother to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55264:67"/>
the King of that Iſland. This was the place of his Birth, where being the onely Son of his Father, he was bred up with all the diligence and care that might be, he providing Maſters to inſtruct him in all things fit for ſo great a perſon.</p>
               <p>At the age of eightéen years he being dubbed Knight, begged leave of his Father to ſéek Adventures: to which his Parents hardly conſented, in regard he was the onely Comfort and Ioy of their old Age: but his importunity prevailing, providing himſelf of things neceſſary, be cauſed a ſtrong Suit of Armor to be made, and in reſpect his Name was <hi>Peter,</hi> in remembrance of that holy Saint and Apoſtle, be cauſed two Keyes to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his Shield: And providing himſelf of all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſo great a Voyage as he intended to take, he took his leave of his Parents, his Mother giving him thrée rich Iewels at his departure, and her Bleſſing, and ſo he departed, taking ſhipping for <hi>England,</hi> where he arrived and performed many valiant Déeds of Arms: But his reſolution being to ſée ſtrange and far Countreys, he ſoon took ſhipping again, and croſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Narrow Seas arrived in <hi>France,</hi> where at the Court of that King he performed brave Feats at Arms at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of one of the Noblemens Daughters.</p>
               <p>And leaving a great fame of his Valor behinde him, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled thorough all <hi>France:</hi> and arriving at <hi>Marſellis</hi> he again embarqued himſelf, intending to ſayl to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there to ſpend ſome time in ſéeking out Adventures: but as he was ſayling thither, the Ship was forced to put in at an Iſland called <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and being advertiſed that a great Feaſt was held there in Honor of the Kings Coronation-Day, and that there was many Knights there who approved their valors in running a Tilt, and ſuch kinde of honorable Exerciſes, he reſolved to ſpend ſome time amongſt them; which he did to his great advantage, for he ſo well demeaned himſelf that he got the ſole honor of the Tournament, and he carried himſelf ſo courteouſly to all, that he not onely got the good will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King and Quéen, but alſo of their Daughter the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Magdalena,</hi> who was ſo wounded by the little God <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> that ſhe knew not what to do: in vain was it to ſmother her
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55264:67"/>
affection, which ſhe ſtrived by all means poſſible to do, but could not, ſo that an ancient Woman her Nurſe with whom ſhe had béen bred, did diſcover that ſomewhat was the matter more than ordinary with her Miſtriſs, and although ſhe uſed many ways to finde what ſhould be the matter, yet ſhe failed in all, till at length the Princeſs not being any longer able to ſmother her affection, diſcovered it to her Nurſe, begging of her not onely to kéep it concealed, but alſo to give her the beſt advice that ſhe could.</p>
               <p>The Nurſe now knowing the Diſeaſe of her Miſtriſs, began to apply Remedies, and like a diſcréet perſon told her, that it was altogether unfit for her who was the Daughter of a King, and ſo great a Beauty as ſhe was, that the greateſt Princes in the world might account themſelves happy in the enjoyment of her, that ſhe ſhould ſet her love and affection on a ſimple Knight, one who was but a private perſon, and it was unknown whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was nobly deſcended, or not.</p>
               <p>To which the Princeſs ſoon replyed, That ſhe was confident he was not of mean Parentage, but of Princely Birth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Princely Endowments and Qualifications that ſhe ſaw he was endued with; and therefore if ſhe would do her any ſervice it muſt be in this occaſion, to finde ſome way to diſcourſe with him, and gain ſome knowledge of him from himſelf, for ſhe was reſolved in her love, and that it could not any wayes be diverted.</p>
               <p>The Nurſe ſéeing this, deſired her to ſmother her paſſions as well as ſhe could, that the King and Quéen might not diſcover any thing from her, and that ſhe would take ſome ſpéedy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to give her ſome ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>In theſe tearms ſhe left the Princeſs, who promiſed to be guided herein by her advice, and ſought opportunity to ſpeak to the Knight, which ſhe ſoon found, for he was as déeply in love with the Princeſs, as ſhe was with him, and deſired nothing more than to have an opportunity to ſpeak to this old Lady, who he ſaw was very converſant with the Princeſs, and did believe was her Confident. They being both equally deſirous of one and the ſame thing, méeting together ſhe began to him thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:55264:68"/>
                  <hi>Sir Knight, I much marvel that you keep your ſelf ſo concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for I very well know that the King, Queen, and the fair Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> would be very glad to know your Linage and Countrey, eſpecially my Lady <hi>Magdalena;</hi> and if you would be pleaſed to tell it to me, I ſhall inform her therein, which I know will be a great ſatisfaction to her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Knight hearing this diſcourſe, and perceiving that it was occaſioned by the Princeſs, gave her this Anſwer:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſince his departure from his Parents he had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf to any, and that the Princeſs ſhould command more from him than any perſon in the world: but ſhe muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him in this particular, onely you may certifie her in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that I am born of Princely Parentage, and that I am her very humble ſervant: And I pray Madam (ſaid he) remember my hearty love and ſervice to her, and give her on my behalf this Jewel.</hi> And thereupon he gave her one of the Iewels his Mother had given him, which the old Lady received, and ſo they parted.</p>
               <p>She in all haſte coming to the Princeſs, gave her the effects of her diſcourſe, and the Iewel; at which ſhe was extreamly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and ſtill every day was more and more entangled and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared in the bonds of Love: and thereupon ſhe cauſed the old Lady to have another Conference with him. At which ſecond Conference he told her, that if the Princeſs would be pleaſed to grant him private acceſs to her, he would give her a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory account of his Eſtate and Condition: the which the old Lady promiſed to effect, and thereupon he gave her another Iewel to preſent to the Princeſs in his behalf, which ſhe did accordingly, and then the Princeſs was more ſatisfied then before, longing for the appointed time when he was to come: Which prefixed time being come, he accordingly came to viſit her, and was admitted into her Preſence, where after his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities tendered to her, he diſcovered himſelf to her, and of what Linage he was, and not onely ſo, but ſéeing how matters went, he diſcovered his love to her: At which ſhe was not at all diſcontented, but told him of hers to him, to the great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of them both; and there they ſo ordered the matter, that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55264:68"/>
they concluded to be at the diſpoſe of one another during life, and he in teſtimony of his love gave her another Iewel, more worth than both the former; all which he had, as I told you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, received of his Mother: and ſhe in return took a Gold Chain from her neck, and beſtowed it upon him, the which he received in hearty good will. All this was done in private, not ſo much as the old Lady being preſent; and when they had thus done and the old Lady was come, after many farewels, though unwilling, he departed.</p>
               <p>This buſineſs being thus concluded on, he lived long time in the Court, and ſtill was in the ſame credit with the King and Quéen. At length he was reſolved further to try the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his Princeſs, and thereupon took an opportunity to ſpeak to her, and told her that now he had béen there a long time, and ſaw no way how to gain the good will of her Father and Mother, and therefore reſolved to go home and viſit his Parents. At which diſcourſe ſhe was much troubled, for her great love to him would not permit of any ſeparation, but ſhe rather reſolved to leave Father and Mother, and all her friends, than be without him, and therefore it was reſolved that ſhe ſhould go with him, and he prepared a ſmall Barque to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: which when it was ready at the time appointed, he in company of his Princeſs entred, ſhe taking with her a good quantity of Gold and Iewels, and ſo they departed and left <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> with a reſolution to go towards his own Countrey.</p>
               <p>No ſooner were they gone, but the Princeſs was miſſed at Court, and the King after ſome enquiry, hearing which way they were gone, ſent ſeveral Ships after them, but it was in vain; for a Tempeſt had forced the Barque in which the Knight and the Princeſs were, quite another way, and drave them on ſhore at another Iſland called <hi>Sicillia,</hi> where their Barque be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſplit they got on ſhore, being both glad and ſorry for their good and ill fortune, where the Lady after ſome travel by land to finde a houſe where to repoſe themſelves, being weary, ſate down, and drawing forth a little red Purſe, ſhewed her Knight the thrée Iewels he had given her: at which he was joyful that ſhe had not left them behinde; and laying it by her, ſhe being
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55264:69"/>
very weary, fell aſléep, and he lay lovingly by her; but ſome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Fowl flying by, and ſéeing the red Purſe, ſuppoſing it to be a piece of fleſh, deſcended from the Skie and took it up, which the Knight ſéeing, and knowing what was in it, he aroſe up, looking to ſée whither the Fowl would flie, which did ſoon alight on a Trée: but he ſoon followed her, and diſturbed her with throwing of ſtones at her, till he forced her to flie away with the Purſe; he being more angry than before, ſtill followed her, and ſhe flying towards the Water ſide, he ſtill purſued her with ſtones, which the Bird perceiving, at length let the Purſe fall into the Sea, but it was in ſo ſhallow a place that he could ſée it lye at the bottom, but could not come at it, it being a great way in the water: he attempted many ways to come at it, at laſt he diſcovered an old Boat hard by, to which he repaired, and finding a Staff therein, he intended to puſh the Boat to the place where the Purſe lay, to the end he might recover it: which he could not do, for the Boat coming into the ſtrength of the ſtream, in deſpight of all he could do, he was carried a great way from the place where he took Boat, and at length he came into the main Sea, when, though too late, he would have thrown himſelf into the Sea, if by that means he could have got on ſhore. Thus was his Princeſs left alone on ſhore, ſléeping in an unknown Land, of whoſe miſery we ſhall hereafter ſpeak more.</p>
               <p>But now we return to him who made heavy complaints, not onely for his own misfortune, but that of his Princeſſes: And thus his Boat was at the mercy of the Sea for thrée days, he expecting every moment when he and the Boat ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the Sea; but his Deſtiny having prepared him for more better fortunes, at laſt he was forced by the impetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the waves, on a little Iſland in the Mediterranean Seas, called <hi>Zante,</hi> where when he came on ſhore, he praiſed God for his ſafe deliverance from the Sea, not without many tears for the leſs of his dear Princeſs. There when he had in ſome manner recovered his health, which was impaired by his long faſting, he hired a ſmall Ship to ſearch up and down all the Iſlands of the <hi>Archiepellago</hi> to finde his Princeſs out, not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55264:69"/>
knowing the name of the place where he had loſt her: but all was in vain, for he had loſt her quite another way.</p>
               <p>Thus being croſſed at his ill fortune, he at laſt landed at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and then not caring whither he went, ſuch was his ſorrow for the loſs of his dear Princeſs: His deſtinies after many weary Iourneys, at laſt brought him to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he arrived at the Triumphs held at the Solemnization of the Wedding of the King and Quéen, and there he performed ſuch Knightly Déeds of Chivalry, as hath béen told you in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter.</p>
               <p>The next day after the Combate betwéen <hi>the Knight of the Keyes</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> all the Champions reſorted early into the Liſts, and there the two Knights deſired of the King to give them leave to finiſh their Combate: but the King would not aſſent thereto, but ordered that they ſhould both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt there from; and in regard there had béen ſo much equalling in the Knights both at the Lance and Sword, neither of them ſhould be accounted Vanquiſhed, or Vanquiſher; and that they ſhould neither of them come into the Field all the following days of the Tournament, but that the two Knights <hi>Don Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineo</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore</hi> ſhould kéep the Field onely; which at laſt they all aſſented to, and they performed it to their great honor: for in that time they diſmounted many hardy Knights, but ſtill kept the honor of the Field till all the days of the Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament were accompliſhed.</p>

thereabouts, knowing of the Wars that was betwéen the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> and that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was engaged therein, they not onely conſented to their departure, but alſo would have furniſhed them with many brave Knights to have gone with them, but they refuſed that kindneſs.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Wolf</hi> likewiſe knowing their intentions, and that in their company he ſhould be certain to get glory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Father <hi>Damartino</hi> to give him leave to accompany them, which he did likewiſe conſent unto, knowing the worth of his Companions would be able to kéep him from harm Thus were they accompanied and ready to go, when <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Knight of the Keyes,</hi> being almoſt bereaved of his ſenſes for the loſs of his dear Miſtreſs the Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> and being reſolved to ſearch all the World over but he would finde her; and having a very great eſtéem for the Princes <hi>Don Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineo, Lucidamore,</hi> and the reſt of their Companions, for the great worth and valor that he ſaw them endowed with, he came likewiſe to them, and deſired them to admit him to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in their adventurous Travels: To which his requeſt they ſoon conſented, for they had a very great eſtéem for him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſéen him exerciſe his valor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:55264:70"/>Thus accompanied, they came one morning to the King and Quéen to take their laſt Farewel, when the King told them that ſince they would not take any Forces with them, he deſired that if his Couſin <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> or any of them had, or ſhould have any occaſion for Forces, he would at any time aſſiſt them with fifty thouſand men, and come in the head of them himſelf, and give ſuch teſtimonies of his good will and affection for them, that he would merit the eſtéem and ſervice they had done for him. Having thus ſaid, the Quéen likewiſe heartily thanked them for the honor they had done her, and deſired to be kindly remembred to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> hoping that he and they all, the Ware being ended, would take that place in their way home, whereby ſhe ſhould again have the ſatisfaction of their good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: To which requeſt of hers they aſſented to, kiſſing her hands they departed, and ſet forwards for <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Keyes</hi> was very heavy and penſive, as you have heard, which gave them all ſome trouble, but <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> having a more particular eſtéem for him than the reſt, ſo wrought with him, that at the laſt he won him to give him an account of the occaſion of his melancholly: which when he had heard, he was likewiſe much troubled thereat, participating in the ſorrows of his Friend, and promiſed him that ſo ſoon as he had ſéen his Brother <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> that he would return with him to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and there he would cauſe ſuch diligent ſearch to be made, that he would finde her if ſhe were any where in all thoſe Seas, vowing unto him an eternal friendſhip; which the <hi>Knight of the Keyes</hi> not onely accepted, but promiſed the ſame ſhould continue to him to the end of his life.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe being ended, they paſſed on their Iourney in ſomewhat more pleaſant communication in ſuch manner, that in ſhort time they arrived near to the City of <hi>Babylon:</hi> In which travels we will once more leave them, and turn to <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Companion, the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince, and the reſt of thoſe valiant warriors that were ſet down before the City of <hi>Pharez.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> aſſaulted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his Forces, and forced them all to retire into the City.</p>
               </argument>
               <figure/>
               <p>GReat was the vexation and anger of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> for that he ſaw the Wars had held him ſo long from the fight of his dear Miſtreſs the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and therefore he reſolved to aſſault his Enemies, and force them to a Battel, and the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> was likewiſe of the ſame reſolution: Wherefore they providing all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, divided their Army into two parts, which they took betwéen them, and ſo with their whole Forces ſet upon the Enemy in their Entrenchments, and having given them the Alarm, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it with ſo much puiſſance, that they ſoon forced them to retire to the City Walls.</p>
               <p>The Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> being advertiſed hereof came forth, and at the Head of fifty thouſand valiant men went to méet <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> whom he ſoon found and knew by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of his blows: the preſence of the Emperor gave ſome
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55264:71"/>
new courage to his Soldiers, and he engaging with <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> cauſed them that were about to flée into the City, to face about and return upon their Enemies, and then there was a fierce Slaughter on all ſides.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> with a party of fifty thouſand men rode up and down the Field, to give his aſſiſtance to that part or place where there was moſt néed: and there was one party of the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond's</hi> Foot-ſoldiers of about fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, who kept cloſe together, and did much harm to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, being commanded and guarded by ten ſtrong Gyants, whom the <hi>Numidian</hi> attempted to diſperſe, but they were all ſo reſolute that he could not break through their Rancks; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he attempted them a new way, and retiring from them firſt, ordered his Squadrons in the faſhion of a Wedge, the Front not being above twenty Knights, but the Rear was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five hundred men broad, and be in the Head of this party forced with his twenty Knights into the Ranks of his Enemies Squadron, and maugre all the reſiſtance of the Gyants and the reſt, he went into the body of the Army, and being gone ſo far, the reſt followed him, till at length the Rear of his Squadron opening to the right and left, and ſo whéeling about both ways encompaſſed the Enemies whole Squadron, engaging them in Front, Rear, Flanks and Middle, and indéed on all ſides at one and the ſame time, he had ſuch ſucceſs that in ſhort time he killed moſt of them, ſo that of fifty thouſand men there was not left one thouſand alive.</p>
               <p>All this while the Emperor himſelf was fighting valiantly with <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> where be gave and received many wounds, but there was little advantage betwéen them, by reaſon they were hindred by the multitude of other Knights that fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. This incenſed <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> being full of wrath that he could not execute the Revenge he intended on his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but before they were parted he gave him on large wound on the ſhoulder, and then the company increaſing he was forced to leave him, and ſo he fell into the Rancks of his Enemies, being much angred; the effects of which cauſed the death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon, for he ſeldom gave a ſtroke but death immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55264:72"/>
He was attended by the Prince of <hi>Meſapotamia,</hi> the <hi>Knight of the Flaming Sword,</hi> and the <hi>Knight of Hope,</hi> who did very well teſtifie themſelves to be valiant Knights, and good Practitioners in <hi>Bellonas</hi> Field: great was the ſlaughter where they came, but far greater where the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> was; for he had deſtroyed all his foes, and was now coming to <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> to aſſiſt him, but he néeded little of his aid: for like a roaring Lyon he flew like Lightening into all places of the Field.</p>
               <p>The Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> hearing of the ill fortune of his Squadron of Foot, in whoſe ſtrength he put much confidence, was greatly diſmayed at that Overthrow, and being angred at his ill fortune, he cauſed a Retreat to be ſounded, but it was in a very ill manner performed; for he was forced to draw all his Forces into the City, not being able any longer to kéep the Field, leaving his Entrenchments to his Enemies, and with great difficulty did he get into the City, for he was hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by his Enemies, and many of his men ſlain: but at the length into the City he got, and made faſt the gates, and then <hi>Don Bellianis, Baltaſano</hi> of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and all their Forces being hindered from going further, were forced to ſtay: But coming into the place where their Enemies had encamped, they found very good Booty, which gave a great ſatisfaction to the Soldiers, their General having given them frée leave to take all they could get. This being done, they fortified themſelves in their Enemies Entrenchments, the two Generals reſolving not only to continue cloſe Siege to the City, but alſo to aſſault them there, ſetting Pionéers to work to undermine ſome part of the City Wall, that they might make a breach and ſo enter to them, and all the other ways that they could invent or imagine they put into practice: but the deſign at that time was hindred, for the City was ſoon after relieved by the arrival of freſh Supplies, as ſhall be hereafter declared to you. And now we will for a while turn back to <hi>Babylon</hi> to the Souldans Pallace, and ſée what the Ladies did; which we ſhall ſhew you in the next Chapter.</p>

                     <p>SInce my arrival with your Forces I have been indifferently fortunate, for I have not onely ſatisfied the mindes of your own Subjects in the way that I marched, but have alſo received much aid by their voluntary aſſiſtance, which I accepted of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Orders that you ſent me, and we have had ſome Engagement with the Enemy to a very good advantage; for we have forced him to leave your Countrey, part of which he was entred into, and retire into his own with much loſs and diſadvantage. The Arrival of the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> was very importunely done, for we were then engaging the Enemy, who is ſo wilfully reſolute, that without the aid he brought we ſhould have had ſome diſadvantage.</p>
                     <p>The Offers of Peace you ſent were tendred to the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> but he in hopes of Aſſiſtance from his Neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings, is ſtill reſolute to proceed in the War, unleſs he may have the Princeſs your Daughter offered up to him: Which Propoſitions of his we wholly declined, and ſuch is the anger of your Subjects at his Arrogancy in propounding things ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that rather than their Princeſs ſhall be expoſed to a thing ſo diſagreeable to her inclination, they will all loſe their lives. If, Sir, you continue in this opinion (as I hope your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty will never condeſcend to a thing ſo baſe and mean, as the proſtitution of your Daughter, to have peace with your Enemy) I then queſtion not but to force your Enemy to very good tearms, and much to your advantage. If the Aid the Emperor expects does come in to him, it will occaſion the lengthening of the War, and you ſome trouble to ſend ſome freſh Supplies, which I queſtion not your readineſs to perform; And Sir, aſſure your ſelf, that in ſo juſt a Cauſe as this, I ſhall not onely hazard my own perſon to the utmoſt perils, but rather
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55264:73"/>
than condeſcend to any thing that is baſe, I ſhall be able of my ſelf to raiſe ſuch Friends as ſhall bring me two hundred thouſand men to juſtifie this Quarrel, and be revenged of your unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Enemies: But I hope, Sir, ere any freſh Supplies come to the Enemy, that we ſhall be able to compel him to put an end to this War: And aſſure your ſelf that all my utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors ſhall not be wanting in execution of this publique Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, as hitherto I have been ready to hazard my perſon in the preſervation of your Perſon, and that of your Family, and I ſhall think my ſelf ſufficiently ſatisfied, if for all my trouble and travel you will do me the honor to permit me to be a ſervant to You and your Family, and more particularly to be admitted by your fair Daughter as a ſervant to her Vertues; In expectation of which I ſhall account nothing dear, ſo as I may be admitted for her Champion, and I queſtion not but I ſhall give a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to you all; which I make my reſolve to do, or die</p>

               <p>Great ſatisfaction did this Letter give to the Souldan, not onely for the good Succeſs that his Forces had already obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but for theit reſolution to continue conſtant to him: He conſidered that he had great cauſe to be thankful to the <hi>Knight of the Baſilisks</hi> (for ſo he was called at Court, not being known by any other Name there:) he had béen much bound to him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for delivering Him and his Daughter from the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Tent, as it was ſet down in the firſt Book of this Hiſtory, for the Aſſiſtance he had given his Couſin the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Aurora,</hi> in helping her to her Kingdom of <hi>Antioch;</hi> for his delivering his Couſin the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> and her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> from the power of the Gyant <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifer</hi> and his Companions, and more eſpecially for releaſing him from the Enchantment in the Iſland, to the extraordinary great peril of his perſon, and now at laſt he was engaged in a long and troubleſom War, and had performed very well already
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55264:74"/>
in it, and had ſent him his reſolutions to perſiſt therein, and all the advantage he deſired and propounded to himſelf for all theſe ſo ſignal Services, was onely to be admitted a Servant and Champion to his Daughter, whoſe Cauſe he was now fighting in.</p>
               <p>Theſe he thought ſo reaſonable, that he immediately ſent for his Daughter, and being reſolved to do nothing as to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without her conſent, he told her the effect of the Knights Letter, and withal informed her of his Requeſt, deſiring her that if it were not wholly againſt her inclination, that ſhe would grant the Requeſt of the Knight.</p>
               <p>She who was as deſirous of this as he was, and had not only a good will, but an extraordinary affection for him, anſwered her Father, That ſhe conſidered the Obligations they were all bound to <hi>the Knight of the Baſilisks</hi> in were ſo many, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhe was ready to do that, as alſo any thing elſe that her Father ſhould deſire that would give a ſatisfaction to <hi>the Knight of the Baſilisks,</hi> who ſhe ſaid, ſhe believed was ſent by the Gods for the preſervation of her and all her Family, and was certainly the Titular Angel of their Countrey. And ſhe further added, that were ſhe knowing of his Birth and Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that it were equal to hers, and the good Will of her Father and Friends joyned to her own Inclination, ſhe ſhould do that willingly for him which the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to force her to, ſo greatly was ſhe ſatisfied, not onely in the Courage and Magnanimity, but alſo in the Vertues of <hi>the Knight of the Baſilisks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When ſhe had ſaid thus ſhe held her peace, and ſomewhat bluſhed that ſhe had ſo plainly diſcovered her affection to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but ſhe was ſomewhat ſatisfied when her Father gave her this Reply, That he was wholly of her opinion, and that he queſtioned not but one ſo every way accompliſhed, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of an Illuſtrious Birth; and that he would endeavor to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelf in his Birth, in the mean time he adviſed his Daughter to write to the Knight, and give him ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as ſhe ſhould think fit: And he ſaid, he queſtioned not but he was of an extraordinary Quality, for he propounded the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55264:74"/>
Raiſing two hundred thouſand men to fight under him in this Service.</p>
               <p>This was the diſcourſe betwéen the Emperor and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which being ended ſhe retired into her Cloſet, where ſhe was expected by her Couſin the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Letters from <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> one for her ſelf, and another for her Couſin.

               <p>The Princeſs having read this Letter, returned it to her Couſin, and then they conferred together what was neceſſary to be done.

               <p>Greatly ſatisfied was the Souldan when he had read this Letter, for now he knew that which he ſo much deſired, the Quality of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and ſéeing his two Brothers, and knowing that they were all of his Alliance, he aroſe from his Seat and kindly embraced them, and bid them heartily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, telling them that he accounted himſelf extreamly happy in their company, and that he was more obliged to their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Friend <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> than to all the perſons on the earth.</p>
               <p>They gave him many thankes for the good eſtéem he had of them, and told him that they were likewiſe ready to ſerve him in what occaſion ſoever he ſhould employ them: and ſince <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was abſent, they deſired his leave for them to depart towards him. The Souldan conſented to this, but withal he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55264:77"/>
deſired them to take ſome Forces with them, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly agréed on.</p>
               <p>Thus after this Diſcourſe with the Souldan, he conducted them to the preſence of the Empereſs and her Daughter the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and her Couſin <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> and the reſt of the Ladies; which pleaſant Sight gave a great content to all the Knights but <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but in him it renewed his ſorrow for the loſs of his Princeſs <hi>Magdalena.</hi> The Empereſs and Ladies being informed by the Souldan of the Quality of the Knights, and that they were Brothers and néer Relations of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> was much pleaſed with their company, and giving them their hands to kiſs, told them that ſhe was very joyful to ſée them: the Princeſſes <hi>Florisbella</hi> and <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> did likewiſe kindly receive them: and the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> was not onely joyful for their arrival, but alſo greatly contented that now her Father was ſatisfied in the true Quality of <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis.</hi>

               <p>At length after ſeveral Complements the Knights were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, and after a ſhort repaſt the Souldan called them to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, wherein it was concluded, that they ſhould depart the next day, and carry with them fifty thouſand men who were all ready for the march, to go and aſſiſt <hi>Don Bellianis.</hi>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <figure/>
               <p>IN ſome diſtreſs was the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> by reaſon of his being ſo cloſely beſieged in the City of <hi>Pharez,</hi> but the expectation he had to be relieved by his Friends, gave him ſome ſatisfaction, and ſtill continued him in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reſolutions of not agréeing to the end of the War, unleſs it were on the Conditions he had formerly propounded to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> who you know was reſolved rather to die than to yield to any ſuch Propoſals, and therefore he and the Prince of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia</hi> endeavored all they could to gain the City, but it was ſo well fortified that it was very difficult: however they cauſed the Mines to be made to undermine the Wall, but before they hadended that, news came of the Arrival of freſh Supplies to to the Emperor, whereupon they prepared themſelves to reſiſt them, and to hinder (if poſſible) their entrance into the City.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Emperor heared in battel, gave <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> a mighty blow over the Helmet, but be ſoon required it by returning him another on the ſhoulder, which deſcending down, wounded him on the Arm. Thus was the Fight on all ſides vigorouſly proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: But the Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> being wholly deſirous to force their way into the City, made it their whole buſineſs to yet thither, and ſo by degrées they got ground, till at length both the Armies came in ſight of one another, and then the Emperors Forces ſéeing that they were likely to be ſo well relieved, gave a great ſhout, and j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55264:79"/>
together: the noiſe that they made gave ſome diſquiet to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> who was ſtill fighting with the Emperor, and being deſirous to know what was the matter, he reached the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſo mighty a blow that he remained without féeling, and ſo he turned his horſe towards the place from whence the noiſe came, and then he ſoon diſcovered that the occaſion of it was the Arrival of the two Kings into the Army with their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He preſently furiouſly rode through all the Ranks of his Enemies, doing much execution, till he arrived at the place where the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> was engaged in fight with two mighty Gyants; one of which he preſently aſſailed, and with leſs than thrée ſtrokes laid him dead at his féet, when turning about he ſaw that his Companion the <hi>Numidian</hi> had likewiſe killed the other: and ſo they both agréed to retire to their own Forces to ſée how the Fight was maintained, and ſo making their way by the death of many of their Adverſaries, they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at their own Camp, where they ſaw the two Knights of <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>the Flaming Sword,</hi> bravely engaged with ſix coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Knights, and yet they defended themſelves very valor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: they ſoon joyned with them to the loſs of all the lives of the ſix Knights.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Emperor being frée endeavored to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Forces, and coming to the two Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> after ſome Complements, he deſired them likewiſe to draw off their Forces, which being done they all retired into the City, but with the loſs of twenty thouſand men, <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> and his Forces following them to the very gates. When they were entered the City, the Emperor conducted the two Kings to the Pallace, where he entertained them and gave them many thanks for this their aid and aſſiſtance, and then they concluded to reſt their Forces for two days, and by that time the Emperor told them he was confident he ſhould not only have aid from the Emperor of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> but likewiſe more of his own, and ſo ſoon as they were arrived he intended to take the Field, not queſtioning but he ſhould quickly force the Enemy to leave his Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> retired to their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55264:79"/>
Camp, and reſolved very ſuddenly to give them a general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault: but the next day the Forces of the Emperor of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and in deſpight of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> entrenthed themſelves, and kept the Field. The Emperor being thus well relieved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved now to take the Field, and give a Field-battel to his Enemies, which he concluded to do the next day: and in order thereunto early the next morning he with all his Forces iſſued out of the City with one hundred thouſand men under his own Conduct, one hundred thouſand men under the Conduct of the two Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> and fifty thouſand men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the <hi>Knight of the Tyger,</hi> Kinſman to the Emperor of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who had brought thoſe Forces thither.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>In this equipage the Emperor was in the Field, and on the other ſide the two Generals <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and <hi>Baltaſano,</hi> divided their Forces onely into two parts, and reſolving on all ſides to fight valiantly and conquer their Enemies, they bravely aſſailed each other: Bloody was the Fight in all places, ſo that ſoon was the Fields gréen Apparrel turned into purple. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals on all ſides performed wonders: the Emperor on his part did very valiantly, reſolving to get the Field or never return to the City: and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being reſolved this day to ſhew the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55264:80"/>
invincibleneſs of his Courage, he being accompanied by five hundred Knights, as his Guard, in deſpight of all oppoſition forced his way into his Enemies Camp, where with his own arm he ſoon killed fifty Knights, and thoſe who followed him imitating his example, ſlew many of their enemies.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> had likewiſe in another place forced his way into the Camp of his Enemies, and there he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the <hi>Knight of the Tyger,</hi> who was encompaſſed with ten ſtrong Gyants, but maugre all their oppoſition be furiouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his way through them, and aſſaulted the <hi>Knight of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> with ſo mighty a blow on the head, ſo that he was not onely aſtoniſhed, but the Sword falling on the horſe his head, cleaved him down-right, and he fell down dead under his Maſter. The Gyants who were néer him ſoon aſſiſted him, and mounted him on another horſe, but it coſt two of them their lives, the one being ſlain by the Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and the other by the <hi>Knight of Hope,</hi> who was now arrived with ſome Forces to the place where <hi>Baltaſano</hi> was, and then they all joyned. Forces, and the <hi>Knight of the Tyger</hi> being very valiant, revenged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the loſs of the lives of many of his Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> having run through his Enemies Camp with great fury, returned and rode up and down to finde out his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val the Emperor, whom he at length found out and encountred, and many fierce ſtrokes were given to one another, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror reſolving to revenge himſelf on <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> ſhewed the utmoſt of his skill and courage, and gave him a blow on the Thigh, ſo that the blood iſſued out thereat through the Ioynts of his Armor: he was greatly enraged hereat, and gave the Emperor another wound on the ſide: Thus they continued fighting together, till at length the multitudes of both parties that came to aſſault each other parted them, and then they ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about the Field killing and deſtroying many Knights.</p>
               <p>It was now the Noon day, and the Fight had continued eight hours, and yet there was not much advantage on either ſide, till they heard the ſound of Trumpets, and at ſome diſtance they might perceive freſh Forces enter the Field, but to which that they belonged it was yet unknown: at length they arrived
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55264:80"/>
in ſight, and then by their Colours they were known to belong to the Emperor, and indéed they were forty thouſand men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of <hi>the Knight of Fame,</hi> Nephew to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who hearing of the Fight made haſte thither, thinking to get Honor in the Battel, but he fared not ſo well as he expected, as we ſhall declare to you anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing this, quickly drew out forty thouſand of his men and went to méet him, and taking a new Lance couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame, and ran furiouſly againſt his Enemy, who did the like, but not with the ſame advantage; for <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> onely loſt one of his Stirrops, but his Enemy came horſe and man to the ground. He ſoon recovered himſelf, and being angry at his misfortune, revenged himſelf by the death of ſix Knights, whom he ſoon killed or overthrew: thus was theſe two Battels joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſoon abated ſome of the vigor of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by the puiſſant and mighty ſtrokes he gave them, killing ten Knights before he brake his Lance, and then drawing his Sword he ſoon after ſent twenty Knights more to accompany their companions, ſo that now they were not ſo furious to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him as they had béen: He quickly made his way thorough all this Squadron, and having teſtified to them his ſtrength and valor, returned and went to aſſault <hi>the Knight of Fame,</hi> who was now engaged with his Enemies: but at the arrival of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> they ſoon gave way to him and he reached him a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty blow on the head, ſo that his Helmet flew from his head, and he was likewiſe wounded, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> intending to give him a ſecond blow, was prevented; for two furious Gyants op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to him: but he who was uſed to deal well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with theſe ſort of people, ſoon let them know his valor by the cutting off of one of their legs.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>the Knight of Fame</hi> had recovered another Helmet, and came to revenge himſelf on <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> ſo that now he was engaged both by a Gyant and <hi>the Knight of Fame,</hi> but he did well enough to maintain the Fight with them both. In the mean time the two Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> had engaged themſelves among their Enemies, and at laſt they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived where the Emperor was engaged, but they brought him
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55264:81"/>
ſuch Aid that they cauſed the Souldans Forces to retire, and many of them loſt their lives, ſo that they being without any valiant Commander did in a manner flie: This gave great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Emperor and the two Kings, and they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them ſome way, till they ſaw a Body of men afar off who came on a great pace, and the néerer they approached the more they appeared, and at length they were likewiſe known to be Forces of the Souldans: This cauſed the Emperor and thoſe that were with him to make a ſtand, much wondring at this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and not daring to go any further. They made up towards them a great pace, and méeting with ſome of thoſe who fled, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themſelves of the manner of the Fight, and cauſed them to face about and return on their Enemies.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Emperor ſéeing this was reſolved to receive them, but they ſtill made haſte, and arriving néer the Emperors Forces, ſix Knights advancing forwards and couching their Lances, ran upon the Emperor and his Forces, and with the furiouſneſs of the Encounter they diſmounted five Knights that oppoſed them, and the Emperor who was the ſixth, loſt both his Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55264:81"/>
by the mighty blyws they gave, for in leſs than a quarter of an hour they had diſmounted and ſtain above a hundred Knights: and in this time their Forces by their example followed them, and joyning with their Enemies ſoon compelled them, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of the Emperor and the two Kings of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> to retire to the reſt of the Army. When they were all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there they gave a loud ſhout, and cryed out, <hi>Babylon, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon:</hi> This noiſe gave a freſh Alarm to the Armies, and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> wondring thereat, went to ſée the occaſion, doubting that the Enemy had got more Aid: but he was ſoon ſatisfied of the contrary, for he knew the Common Soldiers by their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: but he was much more aſtoniſhed when he ſaw the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Déeds of the ſix valiant Champions, and indéed they were all unknown to him. He coming néerer to them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered one of them by his Armor to be <hi>Contumeliano</hi> Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> wherefore he went to him, and ſaid: Ah worthy Friend! great pains have you taken to come thus far to my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The <hi>Phenician</hi> courteouſly replyed to him, Noble Prince, I ſhould not think it any trouble to travel throughout the whole world to ſerve you, eſpecially in ſo good company as I have brought with me: Then he knowing that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> was willing to be informed who were in his company, told him that his Companions were his two valiant Brothers, <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> and his Couſin <hi>Flioriſpiano</hi> of <hi>Swevia,</hi> and the two other Knights were ſomewhat ſtrangers, but both valiant Knights; and ſo they were indéed, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the valiant <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland, Knight of the Keyes,</hi> and the other <hi>the Knight of the Wolf,</hi> and that they had brought from the Souldan of <hi>Babylon</hi> fifty thouſand men for his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> being very joyful hereat ſoon entred the Fight, and was now again reſolved to conquer or die, and that this day ſhould put an end to the War: In this reſolution he went to his Companion the Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and informed him hereof, and telling him that he would with a Party of Horſe break through the Enemies Forces, and get betwéen them and the City and hinder their entrance, and that he would onely deſire him to proſecute the Fight, aſſuring him that there were
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55264:82"/>
ſuch valiant Knights come, that he queſtioned not to have the Victory.</p>
               <p>Thus did he leave the <hi>Numidian</hi> and went to execute his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſo he did, and ſoon brake through the Forces of the Enemy. The Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> being thus encouraged, drew up all his Forces and freſhly aſſailed his Enemies, and in ſhort time by the aſſiſtance of the ſix Champions, and the Forces they brought, he got ſo great advantage of his Enemies, that he forced them to retire; which they did not do ſo well but that many of them were ſlain. Among the reſt, <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> did gloriouſly; for he flew <hi>the Knight of Fame,</hi> Couſin to the Emperor, and many Knights and Gyants that were néer him. The two Princes <hi>Clarineo</hi> and <hi>Lucidamore</hi> took the King of <hi>Georgia</hi> Priſoner, maugre the reſiſtance of all his Guards, and <hi>the Knight of the Tyger</hi> hardly eſcaped with life, being very much wounded by <hi>Contumeliano</hi> Prince of <hi>Phenicia.</hi>

               <p>The Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> ſéeing that by the means of this freſh Supply he ſhould loſe the Day, reſolved to retire before he ſhould be quite vanquiſhed, wherefore he cauſed a Retreat to be ſounded, and ſo retired to enter the City, but <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> who expected him, hindred him there-from and fiercely aſſaulted him: Greatly ſurprized was the Emperor when he ſaw himſelf ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted on both ſides, wherefore he advanced forwards to ſee who it was that hindred his Retreat; but he was ſo bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by his Rival, that notwithſtanding his utmoſt endeavors he could not get off: but after he had received many wounds by <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> was taken priſoner: the reſt of his Forces in the mean time ſéeing the Field loſt, left him and fled in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order into the City.</p>
               <p>Great was the ſorrow in the City for the loſs of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, they not yet knowing whether he were alive or dead.

                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing the Emperors Forces were got into the City, cauſed a Retreat to be ſounded, and ſo repaired to his

Princeſs <hi>Magdalena,</hi> to whom we will return, who as we told you was left in the Iſland of <hi>Sicillia,</hi> being very weary of her travel, ſlept a great while, but at length ſhe awaked, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a déep ſigh, lifted up her head, and looking about her for her Knight, ſhe could not ſée him; whereupon ſhe aroſe from the ground, and walking about ſhe could not finde him: at which ſhe much wondred, and in great perplexity ſhe made many turnings and walks about the place where ſhe lay, ſometimes ſhe went to the Water ſide to look that ways, and then again ſhe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but altogether unſatisfied; at length the night grew on and he returned not, then was ſhe much diſmayed, and fell into theſe Lamentations.</p>
               <p>Oh unfortunate Princeſs! how much unhappineſs hath thy raſhneſs cauſed thée already, and to what end will this turn? but yet how could I expect any bleſſing in my actions, having left my Parents and Friends, who it may be at this time are in as great perplexity for my departure as I am in, and it is but the Iuſtice of Heaven that I ſhould bear them company in their Complaints: but alas they are ſafe and well in their own Court, and I am here in a ſtrange place, having newly eſcaped the danger of the Seas, in which it had béen better I had béen drowned, than now to be devoured by wilde Beaſts, or to expect a worſer death: It had béen far better for me to have loſt my life in the Seas, for then I ſhould have had my beloved Friend to have born me company, but now I muſt periſh alone and moſt miſerable. Ah Knight <hi>of the Keyes,</hi> what is become of thee? whither art thou gone? certainly this was not done by thy good will, for ſo much barbarouſneſs could not enter the breaſt of any man, as to leave me here in ſuch an inhumane manner. But why ſhould I condemn thée, or complain on thée, for certainly thou doſt more deſerve my pity than anger: it may be thou by ſome miſchance wandring in theſe Woods art devoured by wilde Beaſts, who have by this time entombed thée in their hungry Maws. Oh that I were certain of that, and that I knew where that Beaſt ſhould remain, I would go ſéek him out and offer my ſelf to be devoured by him, that I might at leaſt accompany thée in death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:55264:85"/>Having thus finiſhed her Lamentation, ſhe with extream grief fell down to the ground; but bethinking her ſelf that ſhe was a Chriſtian, and therefore was bound to preſerve her life ſo long as ſhe could, ſhe aroſe and ſought about for a place where at preſent to lye down more conveniently to repoſe her ſelf till the morning: after ſome travel ſhe found a place néer the water ſide that was ſomewhat commodious for that purpoſe, being encompaſſed with great Réeds, where ſhe laid her ſelf down expecting the morning; which being come, ſhe not having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any reſt, aroſe; and not knowing what to do, nor whither to go, being in a great Wood, at length with much difficulty clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed up a Trée, and being come to the top looked about her, to ſée if ſhe could diſcover any Houſes or People: At length ſhe ſaw ſome people afar off walking, being glad of that, deſcended the Trée and went forwards to that place, which was a Common Road; and ſéeing people coming ſhe retired into the Wood a little way, to conſider with her ſelf what was neceſſary to be done. Then ſhe reſolved not to go home to her Father, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to travel towards <hi>Ireland</hi> the Countrey of her dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Knight, believing that if he eſcaped with life he would go thither, and thither ſhe intended to go and expect him: but the habit ſhe was in being very gorgeous and coſtly, ſhe knew that it would be very inconvenient to travel in, and therefore ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with the firſt conveniency to alter her Aparrel: ſhe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had the opportunity of putting this her reſolution into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the next woman that went by was a Pilgrim, to whom ſhe went, and deſiring her to come a little out of the way they retired into the Wood, where the Princeſs told her that ſhe had a requeſt to make to her, which ſhe deſired her to grant, and that it could not be in the leaſt to her prejudice.</p>
               <p>The good woman ſéeing her in ſo rich Aparrel, thought that it would be ill manners in her to deny her any thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe conſented to her Requeſt: Then the Princeſs told her that ſhe deſired her to exchange her Aparrel with her. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at firſt was unwilling, but at length ſhe conſented, and ſo changing their Habits, the Princeſs likewiſe gave her ſome money, and ſo they departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:55264:85"/>The Princeſs being thus accoutred, deſired to know the way to the next Port Town, to which ſhe travelled, and being come thither, ſhe deſired to embarque her ſelf: and enquiring for ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſhe found one going for <hi>England,</hi> into which ſhe embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued her ſelf, reſolving never to return to her Father, but ſtill to travel in ſearch of her Knight.</p>
               <p>The Ship in ſhort time arrived at <hi>England,</hi> and there ſhe was expoſed to a new travel through that Countrey, and then taking ſhipping again ſhe went for <hi>Ireland;</hi> where when ſhe arrived ſhe travelled toward <hi>Wexford,</hi> the place of her dear Knights Nativity: At length ſhe arrived there, and enquiring for the Earl his Father, found him and all his Family in much diſcontent for the abſence of his Son.</p>
               <p>Thus being arrived here, and reſolving to abide in this place, ſhe cauſed Work-men to build a ſmall Monaſtery with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhe brought from her Fathers Court, and when it was builded ſhe Dedicated it to the Honor of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Holy Apoſtle, in memory of her dear Knight.</p>
               <p>In this place ſhe encloſed her ſelf, reſolving to live a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life all her dayes in expectation of the Return of her dearly beloved Knight. Here ſhe got an Acquaintance with the Earl and Counteſs, Father and Mother to the <hi>Knight of the Keyes,</hi> who ſéeing her of ſo Religious a Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, acquainted themſelves with her, delighting much in her Society, and likewiſe did very much countenance her in her Vndertakings, and oftentimes invited her home to their Habitation: to which place ſhe ſometimes went, otherwiſe ſhe never departed from her Monaſtery, ſtill entertaining poor ſick Travellers therein. Thus did ſhe ſhut up her ſelf from all the world, while he was as much afflicted for her abſence, and was in continual care and trouble for her loſs.</p>

                  <p>How the Earl of <hi>Munſter</hi> and his Wife the Counteſs did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Son <hi>Peter</hi> to be drowned, and how they infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Holy <hi>Magdalena</hi> thereof, and of the ſorrow they all made.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus continued theſe Perſonages, the Earl and his Wife, and the Holy <hi>Magdalena,</hi> in continual care and fear, but they all ſtill hoped one day to hear of the Return of their Son and Friend: but they were much perplexed at an adventure that happened one day, which was in this manner.</p>
               <p>Certain Fiſher-men having béen abroad at Sea a fiſhing, amongſt other Fiſhes which they caught one happened to be a very fair <hi>Sturgeon,</hi> at which they wondred, and at their return to <hi>Wexford</hi> they went to the Earl, and preſented this Fiſh as a great Novelty to him: the which he thankfully received, and ſhewing the ſame to his Counteſs, ſhe cauſed the ſame imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be cut into pieces: but oh ſtrange accident! in the belly of the Fiſh ſhe diſcovered ſomewhat that was red, which having taken out, they found it to be a red Purſe of cloth, and having opened the ſame there was in it thrée Iewels, which ſhe earneſtly beholding, knew to be the ſame ſhe had delivered to her Son <hi>Peter</hi> at ſuch time as he departed from her, when he firſt began his travels.</p>
               <p>This ſight gave her great aſtoniſhment, and ſhe going im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Earl her Husband ſhewed them to him, and he knowing them was as much troubled, and then they certainly concluded and ſaw that all their hopes of the Return of their Son <hi>Peter</hi> was in vain; for they verily believed that he had béen caſt away at Sea, and the Fiſhes had devoured him: and in this opinion they remained, making great Lamentations for the loſs of him, never more expecting to ſée him. Then they immediately put themſelves and all their Family into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aparrel, and hung all their Houſe in Mourning, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red every thing as if he had béen certainly dead, and they had
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55264:86"/>
ſéen him buried, ſo confident were they of the truth of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. And thus continued they in great and private mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for many days, not being ſéen of any but their own family. So ſoon as the Counteſs went abroad, ſhe went to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to viſit the Holy <hi>Magdalena,</hi> where when ſhe was arrived ſhe expreſſed by her outward looks and habit, the inward ſorrow of her minde.</p>
               <p>The Holy Maid being deſirous to know the occaſion of this, believing it to be ſome extraordinary matter, deſired the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs to inform her of the true cauſe of her immoderate ſorrow, the which ſhe did with many tears, and the Holy Maid accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied her in her tears, verily believing this to be true, and that now ſhe ſhould never more ſée her dear Knight <hi>Peter.</hi> The Counteſs ſuppoſing that ſhe ſhed thoſe tears out of affection to her loſs, thinking to be conſolated by her, was forced her ſelf to give her ſome conſolation, ſo great was her grief, but ſhe little thought that the Holy Maid was ſo déeply concerned in this occaſion.</p>
               <p>After many lamentations and tears, the Counteſs deſired the Holy Maid that ſhe would come and viſit her oftener, that they might lament together, and ſo ſhe departed, leaving the fair <hi>Magdalena</hi> in the greateſt grief in the world. The Counteſs being gone, ſhe retirdd her ſelf into her Chamber, where throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf upon her Bed, ſhe thus began: Ah unfortunate Maid, how far better had it bin that thou hadſt never bin born, than thou ſhouldeſt be the occaſion of ſo much grief: I was the cauſe that the good Knight <hi>Peter</hi> adventured himſelf in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he has now loſt his life; and therefore it is thy cauſe that ſo much grief is come to his Parents for his loſs. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he looſing of me, hath travelled ſo many Countreys in the ſearching forme, that he is now caſt away at ſea, and become the food for Fiſhes. It had béen much better that I had never béen fair, or at leaſt that I had never conſented to have left my Parents, ſo to torment and afflict them; but Heaven is juſt, and hath now deſervedly ſent this loſs to puniſh me for my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: Ah what ſhall now become of me?

to my dear Parents in my ſight, for here I am reſolved (ſince I have béen ſo unfortunate) to end my life, and for the future do better ſervice to God for the expiation of my ſins.</p>
               <p>Thus did ſhe lament, and thus continued ſhe in this place in the greateſt devotion in the world, never ſtirring out but to the Earls, where ſhe went ſometimes to accompany them in their Lamentations for the loſs of their Son and her Friend, reſolving that ſo long as ſhe lived ſhe would not diſcover her quality and condition to any one: and in this place we muſt for ſome time leave her, and return to her beloved <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Princes and Knights who were in their way to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon:</hi> but we will firſt by the way tell you the News that came to <hi>Babylon</hi> to the Souldan and the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella.</hi>

               <p>Madam, good fortune have we had, that the Gods have at ſo neceſſary a time as this, ſent us ſo valiant Knights to defend our Empire when it was moſt in danger: but withal I am very ſorry and diſcontented that my perſon ſhould give ſo great an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as to endanger the lives of ſo many valiant Knights, and I would to the Gods that we could conſider of ſome way of preventing this trouble for the future.</p>
               <p>The Empreſs replyed, I queſtion not Daughter, but what Forces are already gone (with the aſſiſtance of the Gods, a juſt Cauſe, and the Aid of ſo many brave Princes and Knights) will be able without any more trouble to bring home Victory, or at leaſt to force the Emperor of <hi>Trebizond</hi> to ſuch a Peace as ſhall be as diſadvantagious to him, and he intended to us: but there is ſomewhat elſe to be further conſidered of, for ſo long as you remain unmarried, you being the onely Heir of this Empire, we ſhall be in the like danger, either the love or ambition of ſome perſons will readily prompt them to give us a trouble; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dear Daughter, ſince your years of childehood are paſt, and you are capable of making a Choice, it would be neceſſary and convenient for you, amongſt thoſe many Princes and great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages that ſue for your favor, that you would chooſe one whom you think fit to make your Husband, that thereby all the reſt may be ſatisfied, and we left quiet, and your Father and I in our old age live without this trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:55264:88"/>Madam, replyed the Princeſs, If either you or my Father would propound ſome one that were fitting for my Quality and Condition, I ſhould be ready to bend my inclinations towards him, and willingly content you therein.</p>
               <p>Madam, ſaid the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> I ſuppoſe the Princeſs my Couſin would willingly ſatisfie your ſelf and her Father in this particular: but if you pleaſe to hear my advice, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to pleaſe you both. I believe it the moſt neceſſary thing to be conſidered of in this Choice, to have one that ſhall be both valiant and able to defend this Countrey from all its Enemies: theſe Wars have teſtified that you have Enemies, and therefore it is neceſſary as well to prevent a future danger as to end this: there are ſeveral brave Princes and Knights engaged in this War, and out of the ſame one might be thought of that might be a fit Match, and if I may with fréedom ſpeak, I ſhall name the perſon.</p>
               <p>The Empereſs who had heard her Couſin, liked well of her counſel, and therefore told her that ſhe ſhould willingly not only hear her, but alſo give her conſent thereto, provided it were ſuch a perſon as was every way both by Deſcent and Valor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and if her Daughters good will and inclination were added thereto.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> (very well knowing that ſhe ſhould give no diſtaſte to her Couſin in procéeding) replyed, That the perſon whom ſhe thought moſt fit for a Husband for her Couſin was the moſt accompliſhed Perſon for Valor, Vertue, and Princely Deſcent in the whole world, and the perſon that that Empire and they all were moſt obliged to: and, ſays ſhe, I ſhall not néed to name him further, for this Character does ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtifie that it can be none other but the Prince <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Empereſs replyed, That truly ſhe always had a very great eſtéem for that Prince, and ſhe ſuppoſed that gratitude had cauſed ſome inclination in her Daughters minde; and, ſays ſhe, I am ſure that he has deſerved more of her than all men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and could I finde that ſhe would be willing to accept of him, I would not onely give my own conſent to the Match,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55264:88"/>
but I would endeavor to perſwade the Souldan my Husband thereto, and I queſtion not but the many Services which that good Prince hath done him, will engage him to give him that ſatisfaction, if he deſires it.</p>
               <p>As for that Madam, ſaid <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> I am ſure that the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Prince <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> is extreamly amorous of my Couſin <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and that it hath béen the ſole cauſe of his coming hither, which hath béen ſo much for the advantage of us all, he himſelf told me this, and I think my ſelf not onely obliged to tell you this, but alſo to do what elſe for him I can.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> ſéeing things brought to this paſs, thus anſwered them, Dear Mother, ſince it is your pleaſure for me to ſpeak in this occaſion, I ſhall do it with all fréedom, and therefore aſſure your ſelf that ever ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Empereſs being highly ſatisfied in the Anſwer of her Daughter, ſaid that ſhe would immediately take ſuch Orders with the Souldan, as ſhe would not onely know his minde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but alſo if occaſion be, perſwade him thereto to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all, and ſo ſhe departed from her Couſin and Daughter, leaving them in the greateſt ſatisfaction in the world.</p>

This their Reſolution they well enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, for after a long and bloody Battel, our Enemies were forced out of the Field (which they had before kept) into the City, to their great loſs: not onely the Common Souldiers and many brave Knights ſuffered and loſt their lives, but the Chief Commanders alſo. The Emperor it was my fortune to take priſoner, and the King of <hi>Georgia</hi> who had aſſiſted him with fifty thouſand men, was taken by my two Brethren, and the reſt put to flight, ſo that we may conclude the War to be at an end.

lovingly embraced by the Empereſs; but when he came before the preſence of his Princeſs he knéeled on the ground, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to caſt one glance of his eyes upon her Divine Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. She was this day dreſſed in a Gown of Sky-coloured Sattin embroidered with Gold, and richly beſet with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and Rubies, repreſenting Stars in the Heavens, but her Face appeared to be more glorious than the Sun when he is in his greateſt luſtre: her Boſom fitly repreſented the Milky whey, and in all her parts there was ſo much excellency and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, that it dazled the eyes of the Beholders. Our poor Prince was all this while on the ground, not daring either to look up or ſpeak: but having her by one of her hands more white than the driven Snow, he moſt amorouſly kiſſed that, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ſighs, bathed it in tears. She well knowing that he was ſurprized, ſaid to him, What, moſt Noble Prince, after having conquered many enemies, have you not confidence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Lady, your Friend? He then recovering himſelf, and looking on her Face, ſaid: Dear Princeſs, ſo much tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent light procéeds from your divine Countenance, that I am not holy enough to look up, leſt for my preſumption I be ſtrucken blinde. But conſidering with himſelf that he was obſerved by many in that paſſion, he again ſaluting her hand aroſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an obeyſance paſſed on towards the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa,</hi> who kindly received him: and ſo the reſt of the Knights having performed their duties to the Ladies, he went to his Princeſs, and ſéeing the Souldan was leading the Empereſs away, he likewiſe took the Princeſs by the hand and went after them: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was come into the great Hall they diſarmed themſelves, and a coſtly Banquet being prepared they all ſat down; which being done, the Souldan did then declare to his Empereſs and Daughter what he had promiſed to <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> wherewith they were ſo well ſatisfied, that he intended forthwith to have them married; and therefore not onely cauſed all thoſe Princes that were there preſent to continue in the Court till the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſhould be performed, but he likewiſe ſent into all the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Countreys to ſummon all Knights to come at that time, which he intended to be within fourtéen days.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the moſt Renowned Prince <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> Son to the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was Married to the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> Daughter to the Souldan of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and of the Solemnity of the Wedding, and the Tilts and Tournaments then holden in honor of the ſame.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>GReat was the Preparations that were made for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the Wedding betwéen the Prince of <hi>Greece</hi> and the fair Princeſs of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and many were the great Perſonages that came to <hi>Babylon</hi> to aſſiſt or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at that Solemnity. The King and Quéen of <hi>Antioch, Don Brianel</hi> and <hi>Aurora,</hi> with a Troop of five hundred gallant Knights came thither (as they believed they were by duty bound) to wait upon their Relations: and the King and Quéen of <hi>Pharez, Don Alfiron</hi> and <hi>Perſiana,</hi> with another Troop of five hundred Knights likewiſe, came at this time to render their love and ſervice to the moſt accompliſhed <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and great was the reſort of ſeveral other Princes and Knights, Princeſſes and Ladies from all parts, to ſée and aſſiſt at this
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55264:93"/>
great Ceremony, ſo that not onely the City, but all the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Towns were filled with rich Tents, and Companies of Ladies and Knights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> ſpent much of their time in welcoming and treating theſe perſons that came ſo far to honor them: and the Souldan and his Empereſs were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream joyful that they had béen ſo fortunate as to match their Daughter to ſo brave a Prince, and one ſo well beloved, not queſtioning but now their Empire would be more flouriſhing than ever, and they ſhould be out of all fear of the power of any of their Neighboring Enemies.</p>
               <p>At length the day ſo much expected and deſired came, when all things being in readineſs, theſe great Perſonages ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Temple: The Fair Princeſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> was led thither by the two Princes <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Don Lucidamore</hi> of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> both Brothers to <hi>Don Bellianis;</hi> and he was led thither by the Princeſs <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and the fair Princeſs <hi>Cynthia</hi> Siſter to the Prince of <hi>Meſapotamia,</hi> the reſt of the Princeſſes and Princes, Ladies and Knights, in great ſtate and very good order attending: Being come to the Temple, and the uſual Solemnities performed, they returned back again to the Pallace, where a moſt rich and gallant Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was provided. The Tables being furniſhed with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Delicacies which the Luxury of <hi>Aſia</hi> could produce. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner was ended, every one made haſte to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Tournament, the Princeſſes and Ladies ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves on a Scaffold erected on one ſide of the Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard for that purpoſe, in the middeſt of which Scaffold was placed two Thrones, on the one was ſeated the Souldan of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> and his Empereſs, and on the other the Prince <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi> and the Incomparable <hi>Florisbella</hi> his Bride, and the reſt of the Kings and Quéens, Princes and Princeſſes, Knights and Ladies in ſeveral places appointed for that purpoſe. No ſooner were they all ſeated, but ſilence was commanded, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſound of twelve Trumpets, Proclamation was made that all ſuch Knights as was there preſent, or ſhould during the tearm of the Tournament arrive, ſhould have free liberty of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55264:94"/>
ſhewing their utmoſt endeavours in the Acts of Chivalry, both at the Sword and Lance, provided they did conform themſelves to ſuch Orders as were appointed, or ſhould be appointed either by the Souldan or <hi>Don Bellianis.</hi> And it was further proclaimed, that the Tournament ſhould continue for four dayes.</p>
               <p>The firſt day <hi>Contumeliano</hi> Prince of <hi>Phenicia</hi> had leave with fifty Knights to maintain and keep the Field in honor of the New Married Pair, againſt all Opponents. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day was appointed for <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the ſame number of Knights. The third day for <hi>Don Lucidamore</hi> of <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> And the fourth and laſt for <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after this Proclamation was made, the Prince <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliano</hi> entred the Field accompanied with fifty Knights, and after he had done his uſual Reverence to the Souldan, and the reſt, he took a Lance frome one of his Attendance and paſſed forwards: But he was no ſooner arrived at the further end of the Field, but he heard a noiſe of Trumpets, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſmall attendance he ſaw a Knight compleatly armed in a white Armor, with a Bear painted on his Shield, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompanied with a brave Train of Knights entered the Liſts, and having paſſed on to the place where the Souldan and <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſate, and made his Reverence, be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced forwards to the other end, and there prepared himſelf for a Courſe againſt <hi>Don Contumeliano;</hi> which <hi>Contumeliano</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared himſelf to receive him, and ſo accordingly they ran againſt one another with ſuch force, that their Lances flew into the Air all broken into ſhivers without any other diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but that of <hi>the Knight of the Bear</hi> looſing his Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops, which he ſoon recovered, and by ſuch time as he came to the end of his Courſe, he had reſetled himſelf on his horſe in as good a manner as he was at the firſt</p>
               <p>This equality in our Champions raiſed a new vigor in them, and taking freſh Lances they again eſſayed which ſhould have the better: and not onely they themſelves ran the ſecond time, but alſo twenty of each of their Knights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this Courſe was much to the diſadvantage of <hi>the Knight of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55264:94"/>
Bear</hi> and his Companions; for he was thrown out of his Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and with him twelve of his Company, and onely ſix of the Prince <hi>Contumeliano's</hi> Knights were foyled, and himſelf was forced to lay hold on his horſe neck.</p>
               <p>This Courſe raiſed an anger in both the Champions, which made them and their Companions quickly remount their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and it was then agréed on, that at the third Courſe they and their whole Squadrons, which was equally divided into fifty in a Squadron, ſhould again run with their Lances, and after that try their fortunes with their Swords. Which Agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was quickly put into execution, and they accordingly ran againſt one another with indifferent equality of fortune; for there was about twenty of a party thrown to the ground, but they quickly poſſeſſed themſelves of their horſes, and remoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting drew their Swords, and began a brave Skirmiſh, to the great delight of the Beholders, many of them being beaten from their horſes by the mighty and puiſſant ſtrokes which they gave and received each unto other. But there was this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made before the Iouſts, that none ſhould enter the Fields whoſe Swords were ſharp, but onely whoſe Swords were dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the edge, to the end that none ſhould be killed, and that the Recreation of ſome might not be the deſtruction of others; however many of the Knights on both ſides were with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſtrokes beaten from their horſes, and much brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the falls, and the trampling of the horſes killed ſome out-right.</p>
               <p>Thus this Skirmiſhing continued for the ſpace of four hours, but in the end the Honor of the Day was won by the Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> the <hi>Knight of the Bear</hi> by a fall which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, being diſabled from ſitting his horſe, and being carried out of the Field by ſeveral of his Knights was conveyed to his Lodgings: And then Proclamation was made, That that dayes Tournament ſhould end, and ſo they all departed the Field and went to the Pallace, where they were no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived and ſeated in their places, but at the ſound of Muſick ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them began to dance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:55264:95"/>In this and ſuch like variety of Recreation they continued for ſome hours, till it was time for every one to take their reſt, and then out pair of Incomparable Lovers retired into their Lodgings, went to Bed and received the Enjoyment which they had ſo long wiſhed for, and was now accompliſhed, to the great Ioy not onely of the two Lovers, but of all their Friends and Relations: In which Content we will leave them till the morning, which being come they all aroſe, and the fair Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Florisbella</hi> by the Crimſon Dy which appeared in her love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chéeks, did well enough expreſs that ſhe had exchanged her Maiden-head for that of a Wife: and the Prince of <hi>Greece</hi> by his outward geſtures did ſufficiently teſtifie the ſatisfaction of his ſpirit in the Enjoyment of his Incomparable Lady.</p>
               <p>Noon being come and Dinner ended, they did all repair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the place appointed for the Tournament, where the Valiant <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> with fifty Knights did bear away the Honor of the Day, to his everlaſting fame.</p>
               <p>Thus were thrée of the four dayes ſpent in Iuſting, Tilting, Tournaments, Skirmiſhing, and Dancing, and all other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of delightful Exerciſes: And the fourth day was now come, and Dinner being ended, and every one ſeated in their ſeveral places, the Valiant Prince <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> (who as you have heard was to maintain the Field for that day) was entred the Liſts at the head of fifty valiant Knights, when after the accuſtomed Civilities done to the Souldan and Ladies, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf ready for the Iouſt, when preſently entred a Knight in black Armour, having the Figure of <hi>Envy</hi> painted on his Shield. This Knight coming at a time of Mirth in ſuch an unaccuſtomed manner, cauſed great Admiration in all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: but the Actions which he did gave them greater cauſe of anger; for no ſooner had be placed himſelf at one end of the Liſts in the head of all his Knights, but he ran with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt the Prince <hi>Clarineo,</hi> intending to kill him with his Lance, for which purpoſe, his Lance had a long Spike of Steel at the end, and was made of the ſtrongeſt Wood; but he miſſed of his aim, for he onely ran the Prince through the left arm, and there brake his Lance. All his Companions did run
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55264:95"/>
with the like violence, and intended the like miſchief, but ſome of them were thrown from their horſes: but they being thus armed, did much miſchief to ſeveral of the Princes Knights, killing fiftéen out-right.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> ſéeing himſelf thus wounded, quickly drew forth the piece of the Lance that was left in his Arm, though with much pain, and preſently drew his Sword, ſéeking about for his Enemy who had done him this miſchief, reſolving to be revenged of him for the Injury he had received: but it was ſome time ere he could finde him, and then he ſaw him perform wonders; for he killed ten of his Knights, and laid them at his féet: At length he came to him, and having his Sword ready drawn aſſaulted him with great fury, but it was to little purpoſe; for the Sword of the one was ſharp, and the others was blunt and without an edge: this diſadvantage he was wholly unſenſible of, his anger and rage not giving him ſo much time as to conſider thereof. But at length he not onely found himſelf full of wounds and faint for loſs of blood, but looking about he ſaw moſt of his Knights lye dead about the Field. In this condition did he remain, when about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Knights came to his Aſſiſtance: but they prevailed not much, in regard that they were all armed as the others were with blunt Swords and Lances, and the anger they were in cauſed them to be unmindful of the danger they ran into. The <hi>Knight of Envy</hi> and his Companions being all very valiant Knights, ſtill laid about them with great eagerneſs and fury, to the loſs of the Souldans Knights, and to his great grief and ſorrow, who knew not how on a ſudden to prevent ſo great a loſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Relations were extreamly angred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who were all unarmed, or at the beſt had onely blunt Swords according to the Agréement of the Tournament, but extream great was the Cry, Noiſe, and Confuſion of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and Ladies, fearing leſt they ſhould all have béen deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this unfortunate Skirmiſh. This raiſed the anger of our <hi>Grecian</hi> Prince to ſuch a height, that he was ready even to run amongſt the throng, unarmed as he was, when ſuddenly he ſaw
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55264:96"/>
another Troop of above one hundred and fifty Knights enter the Field, who ſoon teſtified to whom they did belong by the ſtrokes which they gave; for at every ſtroke blood followed their Swords, ſo that he ſoon knew them to be his Enemies: which he ſéeing, and being now ſo far come to himſelf as to conſider the danger, he cauſed all the Ladies to depart, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all his Friends, ran haſtily to their ſeveral Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to arm themſelves; which they did in the beſt manner they could, and returning to the Field they found that above five hundred of his Friends and Knights were either ſlain or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He ſoon made head againſt his Enemies, and aſſaulted them with a great deal of rage and anger, to the great help of his Friends, and to the loſs and diſcouragement of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Many were on both ſides ſlain by the hands of <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Enemy <hi>the Knight of Envy,</hi> who now met together and began a furious Fight, to the great amazement of all the Beholders. They were both greatly wounded and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at each others ſtrength, when in the midſt of their fury there appeared over their heads a great Cloud, which breaking there was ſéen and heard great Thunder and Lightning, which amazed all in the place, and a great Darkneſs was over all the place for the ſpace of a quarter of an hour: at the end of which there appeared a ſmall Caſtle in the place of the Combate, and by it lay <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> along on the earth, and many of his Friends: There alſo appeared an ancient woman who taking a Bottle, put it to the mouth of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and ſome of the Water that was in it paſſing into his body, he revived and aroſe, and looking about him ſaw that which was happened, and ſaw the old Woman, and knew her to be <hi>Bellona</hi> the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs, who deſired him to go about the Field, and pull off the Helmets from the Heads of thoſe Knights that lay there, that ſhe might aſſiſt his Friends; which he did accordingly, and there they found his two Brothers <hi>Clarineo</hi> and <hi>Lucidamore, Contumeliano,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with many others much wounded: to whom ſhe gave ſome of her Water, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently aroſe in very good eſtate and condition, much wondring
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55264:96"/>
at that which had happened. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſéeing this, did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that all that had happened this day had béen done by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, and therefore he asked <hi>Bellona</hi> who and what theſe Enemies were? and whether they were real men, or onely En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment?</p>
               <p>To which ſhe replyed, That in general they were men, and valiant Knights, as he and his Companions could well enough teſtifie, that they were his Enemies, and came to diſturb the peace he was in: and that they might not for the future be in a capacity to injure him further, ſhe had provided that Caſtle which ſhe ſhewed him, and whereinto ſhe ſaid it was neceſſary they ſhould be put: in order to which they all went about the Field, and as many of the Knights their Enemies which were about fifty, as they could finde yet alive, were preſently put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Caſtle.</p>
               <p>This being done, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and his Brethren, Friends, and Knights, in the company of the ſage <hi>Bellona,</hi> ſet forwards towards the Pallace: but they were ſoon met by the Souldan and his Empereſs, the Princeſs <hi>Florisbella,</hi> and the reſt of the Princeſſes and Ladies, who had already heard of the good health of their Knights, and greatly rejoyced thereat. Thus they all being together returned to the Pallace, where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeated, the ſage <hi>Bellona</hi> ſpake to them thus:
